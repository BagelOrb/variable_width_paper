\subsection{Comparison of beading schemes}
We can see from \cref{TEST_naive_accuracy}(top) and~\ref{over_underfill} that the uniform technique causes a lot of overfills and underfills: on average approximately \SI{1}{\percent} of the total target area is covered by underfill and likewise for overfill.
To our knowledge, the uniform beading scheme, as well as the outer beading scheme, is of little use to FDM printers.

The constant bead count scheme effectively deals with underfills, but generates orders of magnitude more overfills compared to the other schemes. 
Also, the scheme comes at the cost of greatly varying bead widths and an average bead width that is not close to the preferred bead width.
Note that most overfill areas occur near regions of alternating bead width. 
For an input outline shape which contains both very small and very large features, the the constant bead count scheme produces bead widths which can fall outside of the range of manufacturable bead widths.
Moreover the centrality marking is not robust against small perturbations in the outline; adding a small chamfer in a corner causes the unmarked ST to be very small at that location, which results in tiny bead widths.

In \cref{TEST_Center_accuracy} we can see that
the centered beading scheme effectively deals with both overfill and underfill and produces desired bead widths in all locations, except for the extrusion paths in the center, where the bead widths are within a factor 2 off from the desired bead width.
According to \cref{over_underfill} the overfill and underfill for the centered, the evenly distributed and the inward distributed scheme are all approximately \SI{0.2}{\percent}, which is a considerable improvement over the uniform technique.

However, according to \cref{widthHistogram} the centered scheme exhibits a wider range of bead widths than the distributed schemes:
the standard deviation of the bead widths in the centered scheme is approximately \SI{39}{\micro\meter}, while that of the distributed schemes is approximately \SI{14}{\micro\meter}.
We therefore conclude that the distributed schemes result in bead widths closer to the preferred widths compared to the centered scheme.
This is desirable for the manufacturability of the beads and can therefore have a positive effect on the mechanical properties and surface quality of the 3D prints. 

It is hard to visually identify the difference between the evenly and the inward distributed scheme in \cref{visualized_accuracy}, because that particular example shape does not have wide features.
However, \cref{distributed_comparison} and  \cref{widthIndexedHistogram} confirm that the outer toolpaths have the preferred bead width more often.
Furthermore, from \cref{smoothness} we find that compared to evenly distributed, the inward distributed scheme produces smoother toolpaths overall.
Thus the inward distributed scheme prevents over- and underfill, generates smooth toolpaths with more homogenous width and affects smaller more centered parts of the print than the other schemes.

\subsection{Discussion on implications}
Note that the current industry standard in FDM printing employs little to no bead width variation.
Properly performing bead width variation calls for adaptations and developments in printers and firmware.
In the beading schemes we set a transition length of $t(n) = w^*$.
That will demand changes in cross-sectional area of the bead up to \SI{200}{\percent} over a small distance that is comparable to the nozzle size, which is challenging for some hardware systems.
Varying the movement speed can be utilised to change the cross-sectional area, but this approach is limited, since the movement speed is constrained by acceleration considerations near bends in the toolpath~\cite{Ertay2018,Kuipers2018}.
Our schemes require a more accurate control of the volumetric flow rate in \si{\milli\meter\cubed\per\second}.
Using a filament feeder directly mounted on the print head (a.k.a. direct drive) can control the flow more dynamicaly then FDM printers where the material is fed through a Bowden tube from a feeder mounted on the frame.
Still direct drive printers require some control system in order to accurately change the volumetric flow rate such as pressure advance algorithms~\cite{tronvoll2019investigating}.
Yet inaccuracies in direct drive systems employing advance algorithms might arise due to the changes in back-pressure required by changing bead size.
We expect that developments in printing hardware and firmware will address these challenges in the future.


Another limiting factor in the adoption of adaptive bead width is the format of G-code which stores machine instructions.
G-code does not support moves with varying cross-sectional area.
A typical extrusion move \lstinline{G1 X$x$ Y$y$ E$v$} only specifies the total amount of volume $v$ to be extruded in the move, not how that total amount should be distributed along the extrusion move.
A workaround is to approximate a variable width extrusion segment by smaller segments with constant width.
However, this introduces errors nevertheless.
Ideally the G-code language would be expanded in some way to allow for extrusion segments with varying cross-sectional area.


% Taking a broader perspective, we note that our proposed inward distributed scheme is a pragmatic solution.
% Rather than deriving some optimal beading scheme from a clear specification of the objective, we propose some arbitrary inward distributed beading scheme and show that it is better than the other beading schemes.
% An optimal beading scheme can be derived if the objective is formalized terms of a unambiguous fitness function, but that would depend on the specific hardware setup and application for which toolpaths are generated.
% This manuscript is therefore limited to showing the flexibility and versatility of the framework, rather than deriving an optimal beading scheme.
