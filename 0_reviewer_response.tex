\begin{abstract}
We have more clearly distinguished our work from existing methods.
We have introduced extensions to the beading schemes:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item the widening meta-scheme is extended with a minimal feature size, in order to allow for a fair comparison between the various techniques 
and
\item a limiting meta-scheme is introduced which only generates the outer $N$ insets, so that the framework can readily be combined with the direction-parallel strategy in a manner common in FDM.
\end{enumerate*}
The results have been recalculated accordingly.
We have developed a new manufacturing method which doesn't rely on custom machinery and which clearly shows the feasibility of adaptive bead width.
We have computed fabrication time results.
We have added a video animation explaining the union of cones approach in an intuitive manner.
We have made various language fixes and improvements to images to address some of the reviewers' comments.

\section{Reviewer 1}
Overall, the paper proposes some novel frameworks which are meaningful to additive manufacturing. Therefore, I suggest it for publication once the following major comments are addressed. 





%\stepcounter{question}
\Que{
Could the authors provide a mathematical foundation for the relationship between the underfill/overfill areas and the allowed variation of bead width?
I believe the proposed beading scheme can reduce the underfill/overfill areas somehow.
But we still lack a mathematical theory to guide the design.
}
\Ans{
The relationship between under-/overfill and bead widths can be split into several components:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item depending on the feature size
\item depending on the change in feature size
\item depending on the topology
\end{enumerate*}
.
In the first case we consider a part with a constant feature size, in the second we consider the rate of change of feature size and in the thirs we consider the influence of 3-way intersections.

1. When considering a part with constant feature diameter $d$ we note that the beading only depends on the feature diameter: $B(n, r) = B(q(2r), r)$.
From the beading function we can easily derive the under-/overfill by summing over the bead widths $W$.
We can then derive that the naive scheme produces over-/underfill at all diameters except $d=2i w^*$, the center scheme for $(i + 0.8) w^* < d < (i+ 1.25) w^*$ and the constant and distributed schemes nowhere (except for features smaller than $w^*$).
We have added a paragraph to the new section 5.1 Theoretical consideration to explain this and the implications for design for additive manufacturing.

2. When the feature size changes the amount of over-/underfill is related to a bisector angle $\alpha < \alpha_\text{max}$ according to the formula already given in section 3.3, paragraph `Significance measure': 
``This corresponds to overfill areas and underfill areas the size of $\nicefrac12 (w^*)^2 \left( \nicefrac14 \tan ( \alpha / 2) - \alpha / 2 \right)$''.
This formula is also relevant for the other beading schemes because the nonsignificant regions are filled in a similar fashion to the naive technique.
For small bisector angles these under-/overfill areas are considered to be permittably small.
We hope that this explanation suffices for the reviewer and the existing text suffices for the general reader.

3. The topology also has an influence on underfill. For example, a 3-way intersection in a 3D model which is a honeycomb pattern with a feature diameter of $w^*$ causes some over and underfill using \emph{any} possible technique, because 3 printed beads come together in the same point.
Also a honeycomb of $2w^*$ diameter causes some underfill in the center;
when 3 beads surround a single point there will always remain a micro-gap because of the high viscosity of the molten filament.
This is handled in Fig. 12 and the last paragraph of section 3.6.

As for `the allowed variation of bead width': our vision \emph{was} that there should be no binary criterion for manufacturability and instead there should only be a floating number evaluation of manufacturability of a given bead width.
However, we have now put bounds on the induced bead widths, so that the reader could compare our method to any range of `allowed variation' according to any manufacturability criterion.
See the answer to question 3.4.

\paper{Beading schemes}{
\paragraph{Widening \revise{}{meta-scheme}}
Complementary to any of these schemes we can enforce a minimum feature size at no extra cost in our framework.
Regions where the model is narrower than \revise{the nozzle size}{some $r_\text{min}$} can be printed with a bead width \revise{}{$w_\text{min}$} larger than the model thickness.
We can simply override
\begin{align*}
q'(d) &= 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{ if } 0 \leq d < 2 r_\text{min} \\
1 & \text{ if }  2 r_\text{min} \leq d < w^*  \\
q(d) & \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\\
\revise{}{
W'(n,r)_0} &=
\begin{cases}
\max \left( w_\text{min}  ,  2 r \right) & \text{ if } 2 r < w^* \\
W(n,r)_0 & \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\revise{}{
\paragraph{Shell meta-scheme}
The industry standard of FDM is to generate only a limited contour-parallel perimeters and to fill the remainder using a direction-parallel strategy.
We therefore provide a meta-scheme to generate adaptive bead width toolpaths only in narrow regions and generate the limited number of perimeters $M$ using the preferred width in regions which are wide enough.
We also take care not to leave gaps which are too small to be filled using the direction-parallel strategy:

\begin{align*}
q'(d) &= \min(M, q(d))
\\
W'(n,r)_i &= 
\begin{cases}
W(n, M w^*)_i & \text{ if } 2 r > q^{-1}(M) \\
W(n,r)_i & \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

These meta-schemes introduce non-linearities in the quantization function.
Because the beading is only evaluated at nodes in the skeleton, we need to make sure that there are nodes at the locations along the skeleton where the non-linearities happen.
We therefore insert extra nodes along with their ribs at locations $v$ with a radial distance $R(v) = r_\text{min}$ for widening and at $R(v) \in \left\{ M w^*, q^{-1}(M), q^{-1}(M) + \nicefrac12 w^* \right\} $ for the transition from narrow shell to unconstrained shell.
Combining all meta-schemes functionality we can generate results such as depicted in \cref{widening_shell}.

\subQue{
If there is no sharp corners exist, then the existing approaches such as Jin et al (2017) do not have to use bead widths of large variations. 
}
\Ans{
The wedge shape of Fig. 1 was chosen because it contains a wide range of feature sizes and is therefore representative for a wide range of models.
Nearly every model induces the full range of $[0.5w^*,1.8w^*]$ using the centered approach by Jin et. al. 2017 JMS,
because nearly all models have feature sizes which span any range $[iw^*,(i+1)w^*]$ for $i\in\mathcal{N}$.
See Fig. 17 in the paper of Jin et al for an example shape.
Only shapes without central regions (a circle) or shapes with central regions with an exact multiple of $w^*$ everywhere (a rectangle) don't require any variation in bead width, but that holds for any of the beading schemes.

Figure~\ref{no_corners} shows an example of a shape without sharp corners, and which also requires a large bead width variation when using the constant bead count approach by Ding et al.

\Que{
How do the authors conduct path planning? Could the authors add a simple 2D geometry with multiple holes to explain the path planning process? As the proposed approach adds more disconnected toolpaths to minimize underfill areas, an improper path planning would significantly increase the fabrication time. 
}

\todo{
Show results on printing time

Mention that the path order is not optimized
}





\Que{
While the proposed approach can use adaptive bead width to minimize underfill and overfill areas, the generated toolpaths are disconnected compared to the traditional approaches. From my experience, a small overfill area does not have to lead to serious defects. But the disconnected filaments definitely have worse mechanical performances compared to the continuous ones. 
}
\Ans{
That is a difficult question.
It might very well be true that discontinuous extrusion lines form a bigger problem than some over- or underfill areas - at least certainly for flexible filaments on a Bowden printer.
However, it is quite hard to find a mathematical approach to balance discontinuity with the size of over-/underfill areas.

It should be noted that even small underfill areas can be unfillable using an overextrusion approach.
For example the microgaps at 3-way intersections.
The viscocity if molten filament is too high to reach into those small crevices.
}
\todo{
count number of extrusion toolpaths?

mention as future work?

That might be true, but the microgaps near 3-way intersections are not fillable using overfilling; the plastic cannot creap into those cravices.
}






\Que{
Why the authors state the inward distributed beading scheme as new? Jin et al (2017) has proposed the strategy to add a toolpath with varying width along the center edges of the skeleton, and with unchanging width outside.
}
\Ans{
The difference between the inward distributed beading scheme and the method by Jin et al 2017 JMS is already shown in Fig 1.b and c. 
It is also shown in Fig. 16 c and e.
In order to clearly address the difference early on we mention the difference in the description of Jin in the introduction.

\Que{
\label{fig1geometry}
In Fig.1, how to justify the proposed approach as different geometries are used? I believe if the authors use the same geometries as in Fig 1. (a) and (b), there would be also underfill areas using the proposed approach. 
}
\Ans{
There are two ways in which we can interpret this question, leading to two responses.
The question can be interpreted as saying that Fig a has a different geometry than b or c.
There is now a black outline to show that the shapes in Fig 1a, b and c are actually the same geometry, and the output is less confusing because we now use the same minimum feature size for b and c.

The question can also be interpreted as saying that one might use a different shape than the geometry in Fig 1.
We decided on this wedge shape because it shows how the techniques deal with a wide range of feature sizes;
the wedge shape can be read as a graph where we can read out the resulting beading for any local feature size.

\section{Reviewer 2}
The paper is generally well written with clear illustrations. 




\Que{
There are occasional omissions, perhaps unintentional, such as the definition of a skeleton - see section 3.1, second paragraph. 
}
\Ans{
Indeed we have intentionally not defined the term `skeleton'.
It seems that there is no generally accepted \emph{intuitive} definition of `skeleton';
the first occurance of the term was as synonymous with the medial axis and it was only defined \emph{mathematically}.
However, the term is now used as an umbrella term for the various different types of skeleton.
We have changes the wording a bit to make clear that `skeleton' refers to an undefined umbrella term.
}
\commits{5356492b5a9a690228ffdb6a6a26cf10d099a7d4}
\paper{Method overview}{
Our method starts with computing \revise{the}{a type of} skeleton of the input polygon based on the medial axis transform (MAT), a strategy that has been commonly used for generating contour-parallel toolpaths~\cite{eiamsa2003toward}. 
}





\stepcounter{question}
\subQue{
The authors seem to use linear approximations of the medial axis - see Figure 2 (b), which is understandable given the fact that they compute the MA with the Boost library. If this is so, can the authors comment on the implications of this approximation?
}
\Ans{
We chose for linear approximations because they simplify the process,
whereas we chose for Boost because it seemed more stable than alternative libraries.

The discretization is handled in section 3.2. Skeletal trapezoidation, second paragraph.
The discretization simplifies the algorithm, potentially at a slight computational cost.
Because we used $d^\text{discretization} = \SI{0.2}{\milli\meter}$, we can expect the discretized skeleton to deviate from the real skeleton by approximately \SI{0.013}{\milli\meter}, which is within the range of accuracy of the hardware system used.
The computation of this value is complicated by the fact that the discretization always introduces a sample point at the apex and at the boundaries of significant portions of the parabola.
(See section 3.3 Significance measure, last paragraph.)
See Figure~\ref{response_parabola_discretization}.

We don't feel this type of discretization error is worth extending the manuscript with.

For example, what happens if the obtuse outside angle in Figure 2 goes to 0? 
}
\Ans{
That figure is reproduced here in Fig.~\ref{overview_outline}.
As the rightmost two points move right the degree of the corner in the middle goes to zero which causes the parts of the parabola revealed are more accurately described by the discretization than the highly curved part in the middle.

\Que{
As the authors correctly point out, the MA is not piecewise linear even for polygonal boundaries. In 3.2, second paragraph, the authors state that "the medial axis is a compact and complete representation of the shape". First, the MA + the radius function can be considered a shape representation, which is not true for the MA by itself. Second, the statement that the authors is meant to be generic, but it is not clear what compact means for a medial axis that is not piecewise linear. One can argue that the polygon itself is a rather compact representation of the shapes considered in this manuscript. 
}
\Ans{
Indeed the statement was meant generically, but we agree it lacked substance.
The wording is now changed to better describe the general role of the medial axis in research.

Moreover, the proposed technique seems to rely on rather accurate control of the width w of the deposited material, but it is not clear whether such control is achievable in practice.

\Ans{
The photos of our print results already showed that adaptive width control is possible up to some (admittedly insufficient) extent.
We have developed a new method for actualizing adaptive width control which can readily be applied to unmodified FDM systems such as the Ultimaker S5: linear backpressure compensation.
We show the results of linear backpressure compensation in a separate figure which clearly shows the achieved variance in bead width.

\paper{5.2 Printing results}{
\revise{}{
Test prints were performed on an unmodified Ultimaker S5 system,
with a standard  \SI{0.4}{\milli\meter} nozzle
and PLA filament
and a layer thickness of $h=\SI{0.1}{\milli\meter}$.
In order to accurately realize a varying bead width we vary the movement speed, while keeping the internal pressure in the system constant.
One approach would be keep the filament inflow $f$ (in \si{\milli\meter\cubed\per\second}) constant by varying movement speed accordingly.
However, that doesn't result in the intended filament outflow variation - see \cref{zero_backpressure}.
We conjecture that the filament outflow is related to the total pressure in the system,
which depends not only on the amount of filament in between the feeder wheel and the nozzle (which we keep constant), 
but also depends on the backpressure that the previous layer exerts on the filament protruding from the nozzle.
We conjecture that the amount of backpressure is monotonically related to the requested line width and compensate for the backpressure using a simple linear model:

\begin{align}
 v(w) &= \frac{f(w)}{h w} \\ 
% f &\sim p \\
% p &= p_\text{in} + p_\text{ext} \\
% p_\text{in} &= C \\
% p_\text{ext} &\sim w \\
% p_\text{ext} &= w / w^* - 1 \\
% f &= f^* - k p_\text{ext} \\
 f(w) &= f_0 - k \left( w / w_0 - 1 \right) \\
 f_0 &= v_0 w_0 h 
% v &= \frac{f^* - k p_\text{ext}}{h w} \\ 
% v &= \frac{v^* w^* h - k (w / w^* - 1)}{h w}
\end{align}
where
$v(w)$ is the movement speed as a function of requested bead width $w$,
$f(w)$ is the filament outflow,
$f_0$ is a constant reference flow
and
$k$ is the amount of backpressure compensation.
Using increments of $0.1$ we established that using a factor of $k=1.1$ yields satisfactory bead width variation for our setup where
$v_0=\SI{30}{\milli\meter\per\second}$, 
$w_0=\SI{0.4}{\milli\meter}$.

\section{Reviewer 3}
Paper is well written. It is mostly easy to follow but overall, I find the the contributions somewhat incremental and the motivation not convincing. The paper mostly feels like a technical report. I am not sure if the methods overall teach enough to the researchers in the field to open up new research possibilities. My specific comments are below: 





\Que{
The title is a little misleading that the presented approach may be used for general “Additive Manufacturing”. However, my understanding from the text is that it is designed particularly for FDM. I believe it is important to highlight this in the title. Otherwise, there should be enough evidence to prove that it can be applied to other kinds of printing processes, such as SLS, SLA, DMLS etc.

\paper{Title}{
A framework for adaptive width control of dense contour-parallel toolpaths in \revise{additive manufacturing}{fused deposition modeling}
}





\Que{
It would be nice to discuss why contour-parallel toolpaths are needed or selected. In what situations, these are required as opposed to zigzag style (or direction-parallel as referred in the text) patterns. Without such a discussion, the motivation seems a little weak. In the second paragraph of introduction, there is a short discussion about this but it sounds like the authors assume that even the perimeters (or outline) are printed with direction-parallel extrusion. However, common approach in FDM is to print the perimeters with contour parallel toolpaths and fill the inner region with direction-parallel paths only (as later acknowledged in the related work 3rd paragraph). I think the motivation for contour parallel toolpaths needs to be justified further. 
}
\Ans{
The industry standard is to use a combination of contour-parallel and direction-parallel.
We now clarify why contour-parallel is (partly) used and that in as much as contour-parallel is used, our approach improves on the industry standard.
We have also developed and presented a new meta-scheme for generating only a limited number of perimeters, which shows that our technique is compatible with the industry standard for FDM 3D printing.

Contour-parallel extrusion therefore leads to a less bumpy outline shape than direction-parallel extrusion does.
}{
Because contour-parallel extrusion leads to a more accurate outline shape it is common practice to print either the whole layer or only a limited number of outer perimeters that way.
This paper improves on those contour-parallel toolpaths and addresses several issues which commonly occur in 3D models with narrow geometry.

Related work acknowledges the previous work sufficiently. However, the differences between the state of the art and the presented work are not clear. More discussion on where this work stands with respect to the state of the art is required.

Isn’t it possible to put bounds on the width in the existing methods, such as the approach described in [9]? More discussion on that would be helpful.

\Ans{
The bead width in Jin et al. is limited to $0.5 w^*$ to $1.8 w^*$ , which means the variation is a factor of $3.2$;
this was already described in the related work section, but the factor was wrongly said to be $2$ instead of $3.2$.
We emphasized that our method (generally) results in a bead width deviation of $2$, rather than $3.2$ in the related work section and in the discussion section.

}
\paper{Discussion}{
In \cref{TEST_Center_accuracy} we can see that
the centered beading scheme effectively deals with both overfill and underfill and produces desired bead widths in all locations, except for the extrusion paths in the center, where the bead widths \revise{are within a factor 2 off from the desired bead width.}{range between $0.5 w^*$ and $1.8w^*$, i.e. the deviation is within a factor of $3.2$.}

\paper{Discussion}{
\revise{}{Moreover, because the quantization operator rounds to the nearest number of beads the bead widths range from $0.75w^*$ to $1.5w^*$, i.e. the deviation is within a factor $2$, which is considerably lower than in the centered scheme.}
We therefore conclude that the distributed schemes \revise{result in bead widths closer to the preferred widths}{exhibit a lower bead width deviation} compared to the centered scheme.

\Que{
Is this approach generalizable to sparse infill? It is very common in FDM to use a sparse infill and only use dense fill on surface regions.

\Ans{
The goal of sparse infill on the otherhand is to generate intentional spacing between lines; this is not reconcilable with the goal of preventing underfill.
However, we did show that the contour-parallel toolpaths can be combined with sparse infill.
