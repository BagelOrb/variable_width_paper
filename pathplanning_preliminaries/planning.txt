-- Goal / problem statement
-----

- Why would we need full filling of areas?
 * visible top layers
   > visual prototypes are not so important
 * lithophanes???
   > important for showing heterogeneity
 * thin walls
   > important for Cura, maybe not to other slicers
 * accurate physical properties
   > quite important according to Peter Brier

- Find out which of these are most important for desktop FDM
- What are the usecases of FDM and in which ratio are people generally employing those usecases?
  > nobody knows


-----
-- Related work
-----

- What do other slicers do?
 > generate test model
 > find out who has access to all kinds of slicers


- Look up plane filling toolpath generation literature
 - medial axis literature
 - straight skeleton literature ?

- Look into CNC toolpath generation literature





-----
-- Method
-----

- Look into literature on Motorcycle graphs
- and Straight skeletons

- Look for python / C++ implementations



- What should be the printing order? inner > outter or outter > inner?


- Where to place jumps to a different number of integer polygons?

- Should we allow for single extrusion lines (polylines rather than polygons)

-- Tests / calibration

- Viability of variable line width on itself
* on UM3 / S5
* on direct drive printers
  > Paul Kuiper

TK: "If even direct drive systems need to adjust the toolpaths because variable line width has its limits than why use direct drive?"
"If we have to compensate by software anyway, is the software compensation not good enough to also work for Bowden extruders?"


- Viability of variable line width when printed next to existing lines.
* on UM3 / S5
* on direct drive printers


- How to realize variable line width
* speed compensation
* linear advance for extrusion flow modification



- Transparency of printed lithophanes
* different widths
* different surface angles
