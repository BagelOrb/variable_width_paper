\section{Method}
The general idea is to generate the medial axis transform and round the distance measures,
such that an exact integer beads will fit the polygon there
so that there is never a gap region left over in the middle of the polygon.

We round to integer multiples of half the nozzle width so as to allow single-bead segments, rather than only having polygonal insets.

\subsection{Method Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
\item compute medial axis transform (MAT)
\item find places `of high curvature' in the medial axis and mark those regions
\item transform the MAT distance measures in the marked regions to enable fitting an integer multiple beads.
		This transformation uses transition regions to smoothly transition from $n$ into $n+1$ insets.
\item introduce extra `joints' on the medial axis in order to discretize the transformed distance measure
\item connect these new joints to the outline with new `bones' (In the standard MAT manner)
\item (optional) transform MAT distance fields along all bones, while keeping the endpoint dist measures fixed. (Deviate from evenly distributed linear space in order to have outer outlines closer to the nominal bead width and only change the innermost couple of toolpaths.)
\item define locations everywhere on the bones of the medial axis at integer MAT distances
\item connect all locations with odd distance measure to form the inset toolpaths
\item connect all even locations to form the extent of the toolpaths, which defines the variable width of the segments.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Terminology}
For an explanation of the terms used, see \cref{legend}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sources/method/legend_double_wedge_example.pdf}
\caption{Explanation of terms.}
\label{legend}
\end{figure}



\hl{We need consistent terminology and symbols which adhere to standards in literature.}
The following synonym groups are used here which are not yet checked with existing literature':
\begin{itemize}
\item bones, medial axis segments, arms, fingers, ribs
\item joints, ticks, medial axis vertices, locations
\item MAT distance measure
\end{itemize}


Based on the straight skeleton naming, I would like to introduce a new consistent terminology:
\begin{itemize}
\item marked medial axis segment: vertebra
\item marked medial axis: spine
\item non-marked medial axis segment: arm
\item any medial axis segment: bone
\item bone introduced to the medial axis: rib
\item medial axis vert: joint
\item introduced medial axis vert: ligament?
\item location of an insets along a bone: tick? locus?
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{In related literature}

``Because of its shape, the medial axis of a figure is also called the skeleton or the symmetric axis of the figure.
Associated with the medial axis is a radius function $R$, which defines for each point on the axis its distance to the boundary of the object.''
\cite{lee1982medial}

\cite{Moesen2011} provides a thorough overview of all MAT algorithms.
\cite{Moesen2011} calls $R$ the `feature radius': ``In every point $p \in P$, and thus also in points on the MA, thethe feature radius $\text{rad}(p)$ of $p$ can be defined as the Euclidean distance to the closest point on the boundary of $P$.''

\label{medial_axis_vs_straight_skeleton}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Medial axis rather than Straight Skeleton}
See \cref{medial_axis_vs_straight_skeleton}.
Medial axis handles concave corners differently:
instead of generating the bisector, it will generate a parabolic arc in between the vertex and another line segment of the outline polygon.

Medial axis is stable against small perturbations in the input polygon!
Concave corners are handled irrespective of how many vertices are in a corner.


$\to$ approximate parabolas for simpler processing!
A straight skeleton can be made to coincide with the medial axis by changing concave corners into an infinitesimal circle arc;
this does introduce a lot of extra bones, though.






\subsection{2. High curvature marking}
\label{sec:transitioning_cutoff}
\Cref{rounded_dist_measures}
We mark bones as to-be-transformed based on the angle between the two edges of the polygon for which this bone is the bisector.
We generalize this concept of angle to parabola sections and to MAT sections generated by two outline verts.

\paragraph{line-line-segments}
When the angle between two outline segments is small, the naive method will produce long triangular gaps.
We can measure the angle between two outline segments which generate a MAT segment by looking at the angle where the lines going through those segments (would) meet.
Equivalently we can compare the Euclidean distance between two vertices with the difference in distance measure;
if the Euclidean distance is larger than twice the distance measure difference, the angle between the segments is less than {\SI{60}{\degree}}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\columnwidth]{sources/method/distance_based_angles.pdf}
\caption{Distance based angle estimation. By comparing the euclidean distance between two vertices with the distance measure of the MAT we can skip comparing the angles between the outline segments.}
\label{distance_based_angles}
\end{figure}

The Euclidean distance between two MAT vertices can never be less than the difference in the MAT distance measure between the vertices:t
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.3\columnwidth]{sources/method/distance_ratio_limit.pdf}
\caption{Minimal Euclidean distance for a given difference in MAT distance measure.}
\label{distance_ratio_limit}
\end{figure}




\paragraph{line-point segments}
For a parabola MAT segment generated by point $(0,d)$ and an outline segment lying on the x-axis, the parabola is given by $y = \frac{1}{2d} x^2 + \frac12 d$.
The angle between the outline segments is twice the angle between the MAT segment and an outline segment.
The angle between the MAT parabola and the x-axis is the inverse tangent of the derivative of this formula: $\tan^{-1} \left( \abs x / d \right)$.
The angle is less than \SI{60}{\degree} when 
$\tan^{-1} \left( \abs x / d \right) < \SI{30}{\degree}$ 
i.e. when $\abs x/d < 1 / \sqrt{3}$
i.e. when $\abs x < d / \sqrt{3}$.
So we mark the part of the parabola as to-be-transformed for which $x \in [-d / \sqrt{3}, d / \sqrt{3}]$.


\paragraph{point-point segments}
For a segment gerenated by points $(0,0)$ and $(0,d)$, the MAT segment is given by $y=\frac12 d$.
For a given $x$ the distance $D$ to the outline vertices is given by $D = \sqrt{x^2 + (\frac12 d)^2}$.
The ratio between MAT distance $D$ and Euclidean distance $\abs x$ is determined by $\frac{\partial D}{\partial x} / \frac{\partial \abs x}{x} = \abs \frac{2x}{ \sqrt{4x^2 + d^2}}$
So the Euclidean distance is more than twice the MAT distance then $\abs \frac{\partial D}{\partial x}  < \frac12$, 
%Wolfram Alpha:
so $\abs x < \frac{d}{2\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.289 d$.
So we mark the part of the straight MAT segment as to-be-transformed for which $x \in [-\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{\sqrt{d}}{\sqrt{6}}]$.



\subsection{}
\hl{This section needs to change and the changes will impact other sections as well.}
We need to change the method overview.
The transition placement needs to depend on the MAT distance transform function described below.

We need a good function from a given (MAT) distance $d$ to a number of beads and their widths.
The function needs to be able to deal with a range which is considerably shorter than $[r_-, 2r_-]$, even so short as to accomodate just $[w_*,w_*]$ only.
The function needs to be such that we never overshoot the MAT distance, because that would affect the dimensional accuracy.
Any distance left over which cannot be filled given the range $[r_-,r_+]$ should be placed on the inside near the MAT.

\hl{we should work in terms of $w_*$ instead of $r_*$ because the beads should always have the same radius in both directions!}

The function should be stable:
\begin{itemize}
\item between a location with MAT distance of $\frac12 nw_*$ and $\frac12 (n+1)w_*$ (for integer $n$) there is only one transition to a different number of beads
\item the bead widths increase monotonically with the MAT distance in between transitions to a different number of beads
\item the bead widths change gradually in between transitions to a different number of beads
\end{itemize}

The basics of the function are as such:
\begin{itemize}
\item we compute $m = \frac12 \lfloor 2 d / w_* \rfloor$
\item we decide whether to use $n = m$ or $n = m+\frac12$ beads
\item we reduce the discrepancy between $d$ and $nw_*$ by dividing as much as possible of the difference over the beads
\end{itemize}

We prefer a homogenous line width, so that tweaking the printing parameters for that line width and estimating the object properties becomes more simple.
We can decide on a preference scheme which decides on how many bead widths to alter in a case-by-case manner:
We could say dividing a left-over space $<r_*$ over 3 beads is better than dividing it over 2 beads without specifying an exact loss function on each possible bead size (which would require a lot of experiments to establish).





\subsection{3. MAT distance transformation}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\columnwidth]{sources/method/rounded_dist_measures.jpg}
\caption{MAT distance measures at existing joints can be non-integer multiples of bead width.}
\label{rounded_dist_measures}
\end{figure}

See \cref{rounded_dist_measures}.

In this section we describe how we transform the MAT distance values into a measure of tick quantity.
First we divide all MAT distance measures by the preferred bead radius $r_*$ to get an initial tick quantity measure.
In the simple case the preferred width is in the middle of the range of possible bead widths
These initial tick quantity measures are then transformed so that they are integer values at a lot of places.



In a narrow wedge region (a.k.a. a cusp) we have to transfer from $n$ to $n-1$ beads; this transition requires a distance.
See \cref{single_bead_strategy_overview}.
The transition is such that the innermost toolpath makes a \SI{45}{\degree} angle with the medial axis.
The length of the transition along the medial axis depends on the angles involved.
See \cref{transition_length}.
\begin{equation}
t = r_0 (\sin \alpha + \cos \alpha)
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{sources/method/transition_length_v2.pdf}
\caption{Transition length on a line-line segment.}
\label{transition_length}
\end{figure}

The position of the transition is somehwre in between whole tick values.
The relative position in between the whole tick values relates to the relative position of the preferred line width within the range of possible widths.
For a distance $d$ in between a location on the medial axis with a MAT distance of $nr_*$ and one with $(n+1)r_*$ the transition should be positioned around $d - d\frac{r_* - r_-}{r_+ - r_-}$ from the former location.
See \cref{transition_location}.
However, where should the transition be placed precisely? Should the middle of the transition be at that location, or do we again take a relative position of the transition to be at that location?
For extremal values of $r_*$ the transition could overlap with the whole ticks if we simple place the middle of the transition at the specified location.
We therefore place the same ratio of the transition is before the specified location.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\columnwidth]{sources/method/ticking.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=.5\columnwidth]{sources/method/transition_location_precise.pdf}
\caption{Mapping of different lengths to a ticking. Transition location on a line-line segment is to the right of the middle because the preferred line width is to the left of the middle in the range.}
\label{transition_location}
\end{figure}


\hl{We would like to have a formulation of the MAT distance stransform which defines the MAT distance for any position even if it's not possible to define where the middle of the transition would end up.}
In terms of dMAT/dEuclidean?

The transition needs to be robust against extra fingers in the MAT.
How do we compute the vertex location of an inset on a finger which crosses a transitioning area?
By interpolating the MAT distance between the two ends of the transition, we obtain a stable method for determining the vertex locations of insets.
See \cref{distance_rounding_transition}.
The extra fingers (blue) cause a negligible difference in the inset path (compare the black dashed pat hwith the red dashed path).
\hl{Does this hold for any angled wedge? How about point-line segments or point-point segments?}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\columnwidth]{sources/method/distance_rounding_transition.pdf}
\caption{MAT distance remapping.}
\label{distance_rounding_transition}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Ends of markings}
There are multiple ways in which a sequence of bones starting from the outline polygon can be said to end.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The last node in the sequence is a local maximum
\item The last node in the sequence is not connected to a marked segment
\end{enumerate}

The tick quantity measure should be rounded
where the MAT distance measure is a local maximum: when all directly connected nodes have a lower MAT distance measure.
See bottom of \cref{rounded_vs_unrounded}.



For vertices at the end of a sequence of marked MAT segments we need to take care of transitions.
If a transition is overlapping the end of the sequence, then either end of the transition would fall beyond the area where transitions should occur.
How should we deal with thse?
\begin{itemize}
\item We need to keep the transition tick on the marked side, because we need to switch to a different number of ticks somewhere.
Moreover, leaving out the whole transition around end-of-markings would violate the stability principle.
\item The end-of-marking itself will retain its interpolated MAT distance as described above.
\item The transition tick on the non-marked side of discarded.
This means that there will also be no single bead segment leading up to the transition, which coincides with how we deal with non-marked areas.
See \cref{single_bead_strategy}.
\end{itemize}
This method of dealing with end-of-markings can result in gaps slightly larger than usual.
See \cref{change_to_marked}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{subfigure}{0.45\columnwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sources/method/change_to_marked.pdf}
\caption{before end of markings}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}{0.45\columnwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sources/method/change_to_marked_2.pdf}
\caption{after end of markings}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Transition near end of markings. The gap depends on the positioning of the middle of the transition (dotted lines) with respect to the end of the marked areas.}
\label{change_to_marked}
\end{figure}


It impossible for three marked edges to come together.
(Simple case) If 2 edges of the MAT meet then 3 outline segments are involved; lines through those segments form a triangle which cannot have more than two angles less than \SI{60}{\degree}.
However, what if we connect two marked segments using a small non-marked segment?
There is a distance limit based on \cref{distance_ratio_limit}:
the connecting segment is always larger in Euclidean distance than the difference in MAT distance.






\subsection{4. Introduce joints at key MAT dists}
At the locations where the distance measure changes.
We discretize the distance measure field piecewise linear.
In \cref{distance_rounding_transition} we have one piece at MAT dist $0.0$ from bar $0$ to bar $2.5$, than a piece increasing from MAT dist $0.0$ to $1.0$ from bar $2.5$ to $7.5$ etc.

At the end of a marked section we round the MAT distance measure to the nearest integer and introduce a joint there and connect it to the outline using a new finger.
At those places we round the distance measure without applying transitioning, because the end of the transition would lie beyond the marked region.
 
\paragraph{Note}
We could introduce bones implicitly.
Instead of changing the straight skeleton and introducing bones,
we can simply introduce new vertices on the polygon and generate a new straight skeleton.

\textcolor{gray}{
One could think that this means that the method for introducing joints in the original medial axis should be the same method as used for introducing joints on the newly added fingers connected to the joints introduced in the first step!
}
However, the method for introducing joints on the marked regions may differ from the method for introducing joints on the non-marked regions!









\subsection{5. Add ribs for introduced joints}
\textcolor{gray}{
\paragraph{Angle of fingers introduced on the skeleton}
\Cref{finger_angles}
Cannot be optimized.
Always has to be orthogonal to the polygon segment.
Otherwise the algorithm isn't stable w.r.t. extra vertices in the outline.

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sources/method/finger_angles.jpg}
\caption{Stability against extra vertices}
\label{finger_angles_stability}
\end{subfigure}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sources/method/finger_angles_2.jpg}
\caption{Wrong rib angle, not orthogonal to outline}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Finger angles should always be orthogonal to the outlines}

\end{figure}

\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{r}{0.2\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sources/method/min_angle_of_introduced_bones.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}

Because the ribs are always orthogonal to the outline segments, the angle $\alpha$ between the spine and ribs is within the range $\SI{60}{\degree} < \alpha < \SI{90}{\degree}$.


\subsection{6. transform MAT distance field}
Before generating the locations we can specify a way to space the integer values non-uniformly along a segment.
We can choose to have bead widths closer to the nominal bead width near lower MAT dists and do the uniform layout only in the upper region of the segment.

This needs to be stable against small perturbations in the outline polygon.
See \cref{heterogeneous_joint_generation}.
For any sequence on non-marked bones from the outline polygon inward we define the stable end point as the first vertex which is connected to a marked medial axis segment.
Based on the MAT distance there we place ticks along the non-marked bones.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sources/method/heterogeneous_joint_generation.pdf}
\caption{Toolpaths employing dist rounding vs without.}
\label{heterogeneous_joint_generation}
\end{figure}






\subsection{7. Location spacing}
\textcolor{gray}{
One could think we should not space the joints evenly along the bones, but make the spacing depend on the angles involved.
We could check the intersection point of the lines of two polygon segments and radially project lines with the same angular spacing.
However, the angular spacing for two patches connected to a single bone would be different, so the paths wouldn't connect!
\hl{Does that mean the angle of the bones should ideally be updated?}
}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.5\columnwidth]{sources/method/angular_based_spacing.pdf}
\caption{Angular based spacing isn't feasible. The bottom medial axis bone has different spacing based on the two patches. The radially evenly spaced lines are drawn in cyan for the interaction between the bottom outline segment with the top segment and in purple for the interaction between the second bottom segment with  the top segment.}
\label{angular_based_spacing}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Ideal parabolas}
Subdividing bones introduced for parabolas evenly leads to even spacing along the bone,
while a derived formula seems to produce even spacing in a different sense:
See \cref{medial_axis_parabolas}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{subfigure}{0.9\columnwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sources/method/medial_axis_even_spacing.jpg}
\caption{Parabola transformed to straight skeleton and offsets using even spacing along bones.}

\caption{Parabola function plots from analytical solutions where the distance to the point is a whole fraction of the distance to the line.}
\label{medial_axis_parabolas_functions}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{The equidistant points between a vert and a line form a parabola. There are different methods for generating toolpaths which are in between the medial axis and the outline. Note that the uneven spacing does \emph{not} coincide with an even angular spacingat the border between the patches: see the left side of \subref{medial_axis_parabolas_functions}.}
\label{medial_axis_parabolas}
\end{figure}

\hl{But the uneven spacing figure looks like its evenly spaced in the direction orthogonal to the toolpath itself!}






\subsection{8. Connect locations into toolpaths}
\paragraph{Single bead segments}
\Cref{single_bead_strategy}
We round to ingteger multiples of half the nozzle width so as to allow single-bead segments.
These could be printed from polygon and return to polygon over same segment without extruding.
See \cref{single_bead_strategy}.

We only introduce single bead segments along marked areas of the medial axis.
We could also do it for non-marked areas, but that would result in a small single bead segment at \emph{every} corner.

\subsection{Overview}
Below in \cref{parabola_switch_to_less_lines} you can see the different technique preliminaries thought out.
The problem this paper is trying to solve is the large gap in M0.
M1, M2 and M3 use vertices at specific locations and use altered distance measures for those points; these methods are not stable to adding more bones to the skeleton.
M4 and M5 define distance measures in any location (based on \cref{distance_rounding_transition}) which makes them stable.
M5 avoids jagged lines by only applying the MAT distance remapping up to a cutoff point discussed in \cref{sec:transitioning_cutoff}.
