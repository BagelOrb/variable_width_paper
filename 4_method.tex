\section{Method}
When performing the naive method of offsetting the outline inward with constant width paths the overfill and underfill problems arise in the center.
Constant widths inward steps might not resolve to the arbitrary width of the outline shape.
Our method therefore decides on the number of beads everywhere first and then determines the widths of the beads.
We decide on a bead count at locations which lie in centeral positions of the shape in some sense to be defined below and apply an optimal distribution of widths from the centeral regions outward.

What constitutes an optimal distribution is governed by a beading strategy.
Our framework allows for different beading strategies which can optimize for different criteria.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute a skeleton of the outline shape.
\item Use a significance measure to mark regions of the skeleton which are central.
\item Determine the bead count values in the marked regions and handle transitions to different bead count values.
\item Generate junctions along unmarked bones of the skeleton and connect the junctions together to form the extrusion beads.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Shape decomposition}
The shape decomposition we employ on the outline shape of a layer is based on a common skeletonization of the polygonal outline shape: the medial axis.
Starting from the medial axis we further decompose the shape into simple fragments, so that we can easily process the shape using piecewise linear approximations.



\subsubsection{Medial axis transform}
One of the most commonly used skeletonizations of a shape is the medial axis.
The medial axis is defined by the locations where the inscribed circle meets the boundary in at least two locations. \cite{blum1967transformation}
We call the set of closest points on the outline polygon $P$ of a point $v$ on the skeleton its \emph{support}: $\text{sup}(v) = \argmin_{x\in P} |x - v|$.
The resulting skeleton consists of straight segments and parabolic segments which form a graph.
See \cref{MAT_explanation_circles}.

Alternatively the medial axis can be defined as the locations where the union of cones on the boundary shape is disctoninuous,
or it can be defined as the locations where wavefront propagating from the outline shape make sharp corners. \cite{blum1967transformation}
This last interpretation is especially relevant because the naive toolpath generation method consists precisely in equidistant wavefronts from the outline.
The medial axis can therefore be seen as the space within which contour following toolpaths are generated.
See \cref{MAT_explanation}.

%``Because of its shape, the medial axis of a figure is also called the skeleton or the symmetric axis of the figure.'' \cite{lee1982medial} 
``Associated with the medial axis is a radius function $R$, which defines for each point on the axis its distance to the boundary of the object.'' \cite{lee1982medial}
The medial axis along with the feature radius values along the skeleton combine into a complete shape descriptor, called the medial axis transform (MAT).
Feature radius and node locations of segments will be used below to analyse the shape locally.

%\cite{Moesen2011} provides a thorough overview of all MAT algorithms.
%\cite{Moesen2011} calls $R$ the `feature radius': ``In every point $p \in P$, and thus also in points on the MA, the feature radius $\text{rad}(p)$ of $p$ can be defined as the Euclidean distance to the closest point on the boundary of $P$.''

\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Skeletal trapezoidation}
We employ a shape decomposition proposed by \citeauthor{Ding2016a} which starts from the medial axis and further decomposes the outline shape into simple fragments. \cite{Ding2016a}
Each of the regions demarcated by the skeleton is further decomposed by adding radial bones from each node $v$ to its support $\text{sup}(v)$.
The resulting skeleton decomposes the outline shape into trapezoids and triangles.
We will therefore call this shape decomposition the \emph{Skeletal Trapezoidation} (ST).
(The concept of a trapezoidation conventionally allows for the degenerate case where a trapezoid resolves into a triangle. \cite{chazelle1984,fournier1984})
We repesent such a skeleton in a standard half-edge datastructure.
See \cref{shape_decomposition_simple}.


The medial axis of a polygonal shape can be obtained from the Voronoi Diagram (VD) generated on the line segments and vertices of the shape, by throwing away all segments of the VD falling outside of the outline shape and throwing away the bones connected to concave vertices in the outline shape. \cite{lee1982medial}
However, the concave vertices are precisely in the support of the nodes to which those bones connect.
This means we can efficiently compute the ST from the VD by removing all segments which lie outside the outline shape and add radial bones to the nodes from there.
See \cref{skeletonization_comparison}.


We then also discretize parabolic segments and segments generated by two concave outline vertices into approximately equidistant segments.
See \cref{discretization} and \cref{shape_decomp_complex}.
That way we can approximate the feature radius $R$ in between the two nodes $v_0$ and $v_1$ of a bone in the ST by interpolating linearly between $R(v_0)$ and $R(v_1)$.
This makes the skeleton capture a discrete approximation of the radius function which can then be used to create a triangulated 3D model of the conical represenatation of the medial axis; see \cref{mat_3d}.

The blue segments are significant according to $\alpha_\text{max} = 135\degree$.
}
\label{discretization}
\end{figure}






\subsection{Beading}
We assign a bead count to each node in the skeleton which is in `the center' of the shape in a sense to be defined below.
Around regions where the bead count changes we introduce transition regions, so that we can smoothly change between regions with different bead count.

We mark a node of the skeleton as central if its feature radius is larger than that of all of the neighboring nodes in the skeletal graph.
We also mark whole bones as being central if they are significant according to a common significance measure.


\subsubsection{Significance measure}\label{sec:significance_measure}
Places where the naive concentric toolpathing strategy would create large underfill and overfill areas are locations which intuitively look like `the center' of the shape.
This can be formalized by looking at the significance measure knows as the \emph{bisector angle}.
The bisector angle $\alpha$ is the angle $\angle{p_ovp_1}$ between a location $v$ on a bone of the skeleton and its two supporting polygon points $p_0$ and $p_1$.\cite{attali1996modeling}
For a polygon with a pointy wedge area of an angle $\beta$, we have $\alpha = 180\degree - \beta$, which corresponds to overfill areas and underfill areas the size of $\nicefrac12 w^2 \left( \nicefrac14 \tan ( \alpha / 2) - \alpha / 2 \right)$ when filled using a naive strategy of constant bead width $w$.
See \cref{naive_overfill_underfill}.
The bisector angle is therefore an exact measure of the amount of overfill and underfill in the naive toolpaths of constant width.
%Contrary to related literature we will \emph{keep} the non-significant regions of the skeleton.
We mark all significant bones as such and contrary to related literature we keep the unmarked bones of the skeleton.
Our framework will decide on a beading at all of the marked nodes in `the center' nodes and apply the beading outward to the unmarked nodes.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sources/method/naive_overfill_underfill.pdf}
\caption{
Overfill and underfill areas in a naive beading using a constant bead witdh $w$ of a wedge area with vertex angle $\beta$.
The underfill areas (light blue) are mirrored versions of the overfill areas (dark red).
The bisector angle $a = 180\degree - \beta$ is the angle between a location $v$ and its support $p_0$ and $p_1$.
}
\label{naive_overfill_underfill}
\end{figure}


A computationally efficient way to compute $\alpha$ can be obtained by looking at the ratio between feature radius $R$ and the Euclidean distance:
if $ | R(v_1) - R(v_0) | / |v_1 - v_0| >  \cos(\alpha_\text{max} / 2)$ then $\alpha > \alpha_\text{max}$.
This means we can prevent executing trigonometric functions on \emph{each} of the bones in the skeleton.
See \cref{distance_based_angles}.
This ratio can readily be applied to simple skeleton segments to determine whether they are significant.
For skeletal segments generated by a polygon vertex at $(0,d)$ and a line segment through $(0,0)$ and $(0,\epsilon)$ or another vertex $(0,0)$, we can determine the significant portion by evaluating $\frac{\partial R}{\partial x} > \cos(\alpha_\text{max} / 2)$.
For parabolas we introduce extra points in the discretization at the two bounds where $| x | = d  / \tan(\alpha_\text{max} / 2)$
and for bones with vertex-vertex support we introduce discretization points at the two bounds where $| x | = \nicefrac12 d  / \tan(\alpha_\text{max} / 2)$.
This ensures that the discretization doesn't alter the extent and existence of significant regions.

}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Properties of significant regions}
%\begin{lemma} \label{min_euclidean_distance} >> this paragraph contains two lemmas and a concluding remark!
The Euclidean distance between two skeletal vertices can never be less than the difference in the feature radius $R$ measure between the vertices.
See \cref{distance_ratio_limit}.
The condition $|v - p| = \Delta R$ is true exactly for those sekeletal bones between a node $v$ and an outline location $p$ added by the trapezoidation, which means that the trapezoidation never introduces marked bones, so we can perform the trapezoidation after marking.


\iffalse
% This fact is not used anymore, because we change the marking such that it doesn't hold for marked edges any more.
A node in the graph can have at most two significant edges.
For a node in the VD $v$ with a support of three points on the outline polygon $p_1, p_2, p_3$, the bisector angles $\angle{p_1vp_2} + \angle{p_2vp_3} + \angle{p_3vp_1} = 360\degree$, so if two angles are more than $\alpha_\text{max} > 120\degree$ the third one needs to be smaller than $360\degree - 2\alpha_\text{max} < 120\degree$ and therefore nonsignificant.
% However, because of some filtering operations this property does not neccesarily hold for the markings.
The extra edges added to the VD to form the ST can never be significant because their bisector angle is \SI{0}{\degree} by definition,
so the nodes of the ST also have at most two significant edges.
\fi

\begin{lemma}\label{saddle_points_are_marked}
A saddle point is always marked, i.e.\
when traversing the skeletal graph from one locally maximal $R$ to another we must pass through a significant region.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
You will either go through the marked region of a discretized parabola or of a segment with two polygonal vertices as support.
This means that the feature radius function in between marked regions is always monotonic.
This means that when propagating beadings downward from marked regions they can never conflict in the middle - they will always conflict at either marked region.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{single_upward_edge}
From any node in the graph which is not a saddle point there is at most a single edge going upward.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Any branch point $v$ in the MAT coincides with the circumcircle of its support $p_0, p_1, p_2$.
If $v$ lies within $\triangle p_0 p_1 p_2$ it is a local maximum and otherwise we will show it has exactly one upward edge.
If $v$ lies outside of $\triangle p_0 p_1 p_2$ then those support points lie within a \SI{180}{\degree} range from $v$
and one point lies in the middle, say $\angle p_0 + \angle p_1 = \angle p_2$.
Then a circle with radius $R(v) + \epsilon$ around $v'$ such that $|v-v'| < \epsilon$ can only touch $p_0$ and $p_2$.
See \cref{branch_upward_edge_property}.
%See VoronoiQuadrangulation::filterUnmarkedRegions
Bones added because of the trapezoidation always go down to $R=0$, so these don't change the property that each node has at most a single upward edge.
This means that walking up the graph from a marked region to a local maximum follows a single path without branching.
\end{proof}




\iffalse
% This fact is not used anymore, because we change the marking such that it doesn't hold for marked edges any more.
The two downward edges from a branch point cannot both be significant.
A branch point which is not a local maximum generated by the support points $p_1, p_2, p_3$ has bisector angles such that $\triangle p_1 p_2 p_3$ has its circumcentre $v$ outside of the triangle, because otherwise the feature radius decreases in all directions.
This means that all support points lie within a \SI{180}{\degree} range around the node. 
Suppose the one edge going upward is generated by $p_1$ and $p_3$.
Then the bisector angle $\angle p_1 v p_3 < 180\degree$ and $\angle p_1 v p_2 + \angle p_2 v p_3 < 180\degree$,
so if $\angle p_1 v p_2 < 120\degree$ then $\angle p_2 v p_3 < 60\degree$ and is therefore not significant. 
%so at most either of $\angle p_1 v p_2$ and $\angle p_2 v p_3$ has a significant bisector angle.
\fi



\subsubsection{Marking filtering}
Using the significance measure and the local maximum feature radius condition we initialize all marked bones and nodes.
We then filter out high frequency changes in the marking in order to ensure smooth output toolpaths. 
We perform filtering on the unmarked regions, so that the properties of significant regions mentioned above remain valid.
From each marked node $v_0$ with an upward unmarked bone attached we walk along the upward edges (which cannot branch because of \cref{single_upward_edge}).
If the total length traversed until we reach another marked node $v_1$ is shorter than some filter distance $d_\text{max}^\text{unmarked}$, we mark all bones encountered as being central.





\subsubsection{Bead counts}
In order to apply a beading strategy to the ST we first assign bead counts to the central regions and then decide on how to apply those bead counts outward.
In order to decide on an initial bead count, we require a function mapping a feature diameter to a bead count: $b: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{N}$.
(The feature diameter is twice the radius.)
We might choose different functions for $b$ depending on the beading strategy used.

We first assign each marked node $v$ of the skeleton an initial bead count $B^*_v \leftarrow b(2R(v))$, but it is modified in order to prevent high frequency changes in bead count and it is changed in order to account for smooth transitions in bead count.
See \cref{beading_transitioning_filtering__bead_count}.

We also filter unmarked regions where the bead count remains constant in order to limit the extent of a problem handled in \cref{section_beading_conflicts}.
From each marked node $v_0$ with an upward unmarked bone attached we walk along the upward edges (which cannot branch because of \cref{single_upward_edge}) until we hit another marked node $v_1$.
If the upper node has the same bead count $B^*_{v_1} = B^*_{v_0}$ we mark all bones and nodes $v$ in between, and set the bead count $B^*_v \leftarrow B^*_{v_0}$.

}
\label{beading_transitioning_filtering}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Transitioning}
In order to prevent discontinuities in the toolpaths around locations where the bead count changes, we need a way to smoothly transition to a different number of beads around locations where the 3D model has a changing radius.
See \cref{transitions}.
The length along the marked region of a transition from bead count $n$ to $n+1$ is determined by some function $t(n)$.
Because transitions in bead count only occurs in locations where the prefered bead count $b$ changes, we introduce $b^{-1}(n) := \argmax_d b(d) = n$.

For each marked bone between $v_0$ and $v_1$ with $v_0.B^* \neq v_1.B*$ we introduce transitions.
A transition from bead count $n$ to $n+1$ will be placed anchored on each location $v_x$ where $R(v_x) = b^{-1}(n)$.
We can compute the location of the anchor simply as
$$v_x = v_0 + (v_1 - v_0) \frac{ b^{-1}(n) - R(v_0) }{ R(v_1) - R(v_0) }$$
for each $n$ such that $v_0.B^*<n<v_1.B^*$.
See \cref{beading_transitioning_filtering__transition_mids}.

A transition with length $t(n)$ will be placed somewhere covering the anchor position.
We determine the distance between the anchor $v$ and the lower transition end $v_0$ proportial to the positioning of the transition relative to the preferred distances: 
$$d_-^\text{transition}(v) =  t(n) \frac{ b^{-1}(n) - p(n) }{ p(n+1) - p(n) }$$
%See \cref{transition_placement}.
For the other end we have $d_+^\text{transition}(v) = t(n) - d_-^\text{transition}(v)$.
That way the transitions never overlap locations with preferred bead count.
\todo{TODO: introduce $p$ first!}

In order to prevent frequent oscillations in the bead count, we filter locally maximal or minimal bead count regions.
For each edge which contains a transition anchor we walk along the marked regions until we encounter another anchor.
If the other anchor is a transition in the opposite direction and the traversed distance is within some limit $d_\text{max}^\text{transition}$ we remove the transitions and set the bead counts at all nodes in the filtered region to the surrounding bead counts.
If we hit the end of a marked region and the traversed distance is less than the corresponding part $d_\pm^\text{transition}(v)$ of the transition length $t(n)$ we dissolve the bead count region in the same manner.
See \cref{beading_transitioning_filtering__filtered}.


In order to generate the lower and upper end point of the transitions we walk downward and upward along the marked regions from each anchor position $v$ until we have traversed the coresponding distance of $d_\pm^\text{transition}(v)$.
If there is any node $v_x$ in between $v$ and $v_0$ or $v_1$ we assign it a fractional bead count by linear interpolation: $v_x.B^* = n + D(v_0, v_x)/t(n)$, where $D(.)$ is the cumulative distance measured along the marked bone(s).
See \cref{beading_transitioning_filtering__transition_ends}.

Finally we perform the graph update by introducing nodes at the transition ends and introducing radial bones from these new nodes to the outline as per the trapezoidation requirement.
See \cref{beading_transitioning_filtering__transitions_applied}.

\subsection{Toolpath extraction}
\label{section_toolpath_extraction}
Now that we have decided on the bead counts in the central marked regions, we can apply those bead counts outward along the unmarked bones of the skeleton in order to define the locations of the toolpath junctions.
Because there is a plethora ways to cover a distance $d$ with $n$ beads, the placement of junctions depends on the chosen beading strategy.
The beading strategy is used to generate the radial distances at which the junctions are placed for each node: the \emph{beading}.
That beading information is then propagated along the unmarked bones of the skeleton, so that we can generate the junctions on each unmarked bone.
The junctions are then connected together per trapezoid in order to form the final toolpaths.


\subsection{Beading strategy}
First we determine how we should fill a 	polygon with constant width with a number of beads.
We want to fit an exact whole number of beads in order to prevent a gap being generated.
We consider only half of the polygon, because our beading strategy should be symmetrical.

We define a beading strategy as the following set:
$$
\left\{ b(d), p(n), W(n, d), L(n, d), t(n), \alpha_{\text{max}} \right\}
$$
where
$b(d)$ gives the optimal bead count to cover a total distance of $d$,
$p(n)$ gives the optimal total distance of a given bead count $n$,
$W(n, d)$ gives the sequence of bead widths to cover a distance $d$ using $n$ beads,
$L(n, d)$ gives the sequence of toolpath positions as distances from the outline to cover a distance $d$ using $n$ beads,
$t(n)$ is the length of the transition region to switch from $n$ to $n+1$ beads
and
$\alpha_{\text{max}}$ is the limit bisector angle of the significance measure.

\todo{TODO: Replace `distance' with `diameter'.}

We call a distance $d$ `preferred' when $d = p(b(d))$
For our method we require the inverse $b^{-1}(n) := \argmax_d b(d) = n$.

The following restrictions hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item $b(d) \geq 0, W(n,d) > 0, L(n, d) \geq 0, t \geq 0$
\item $120\degree < \alpha_{\text{max}} \leq 180\degree$
\item $W$ is symetric: $W(n, d)_i = W(n, d)_{n-i-1}$
\item $L$ is symmetric in $d$: $L(n, d)_i = d - L(n, d)_{n-i-1}$
\item $p$ is within the range of optimal: $b^{-1}(n - 1) < p(n) < b^{-1}(n)$
%\item $b \left( p(n) \right) = n$ % follows from the above!
\item $b$ is monotonic: $ b(d) \leq b(d + \epsilon)$
\item $W_n$ is monotonic and continuous at each bead index $n$ for constant bead count $c$: $0 \leq \frac{\partial W(c, d)_n}{\partial d} < \infty$.
\item $t$ is viable: $t(n) < \left( p(n + 1) - p(n) \right) /{2 \cos \alpha_\text{max}}$
\end{itemize}

The angle requirement ensures that there is never a 3-way junction of significant bones. \todo{not true anymore}

By applying the beading strategy to a skeleton location $v$ and a predetermined bead count $n$ we get a beading, which is defined as the following set:
$$
\left\{ d, w_i, l_i  \right\}
$$
where
$d = 2 R(v)$ is the total distance associated with $v$,
$w_i$ is the bead width of the bead with index $i$
end
$l_i$ is the distance of the toolpath location of bead $i$ from the outline.




\paragraph{Beading interpolation}
Skeletal nodes which are in the middle of a transition have obtained a fractional bead count, but the functions defined in the beading strategy are only defined on natural numbers.
The fractional part of the bead count is used to interpolate between two beadings defined on the fractional bead count rounded up and down.




\subsubsection{Beading conflicts}\label{section_beading_conflicts}
In marked regions of the ST we employ the approach of applying the optimal bead counts and employing transitioning, while in unmarked regions the beading is only governed by the beading of locations with locally maximal feature radius.
Marked bones always form chains and don't branch out because of the angle constraint on $\alpha_\text{max}$. \todo{Not true anymore}
At the end of such chain $v$ we may need to transition from the former approach to the latter.
This only happens when the feature radius continues increasing: if $\exists v_n \in v.\text{neighborhood}: R(v) < R(v_n) \land | R(v) - R(v_n) | / |v - v_n| >  \cos(\alpha_\text{max} / 2)$ then the bead count assigned by the marked region doesn't fit with a beading which would follow from a local maximum at $v_n$ or some farther node.
See \cref{beading_conflict_problem}.


\todo{Applying the bead count and determining the beading with the associated widths $W$ and locations $L$ is only handled in the next section, so perhaps we should introduce the beading propagation before the section on transitioning.}
See \cref{alg_beading_propagation}.

\label{beading_conflict_problem}
\end{figure}


The transition length of these transitions to unmarked regions is determined by the fractional difference in bead count between the two beadings:
if $v.B^* < n$ then $t = t(n) . (R(v) - v.L_n)$
otherwise $t = t(n) . (1 - (R(v) - v.L_n))$,
where $n = \argmax_i v.L_i < R(v)$.
At a distance $t$ from $v$ along marked bones we introduce an new node $v_0$ for the end of the transition and again we connect it to the outline as per the ST requirements.


We modify $v.B^*$ such that it coincides with the beading propagated to $v$ from some farther local maximum or another marked region.
(This propagation is explained in \cref{section_toolpath_extraction}.)
We assign $v.B^* = n + 1 - \epsilon$, so that the transition switches from the marked beading to the beading of the unmarked approach entirely.
For nodes $v_x$ in between $v_0$ and $v$ we interpolate $v_x.B^*$ again linearly based on the Euclidean distance along the bones in between $v$ and $v_0$.

\subsubsection{Junction placement}

Now that we have the skeleton set up, we determine the locations along the bones where the vertices of the toolpath polygons should be: the \emph{junctions}.
For marked regions we have already inroduced joints around the transitions which serve as those locations.
For unmarked regions we can simply apply the beading strategy in order to find the toolpath verts.


This needs to be stable against small perturbations in the outline polygon.
See \cref{heterogeneous_joint_generation}.
For any sequence on unmarked bones from the outline polygon inward we define the stable end point as the first vertex which is connected to a marked ST segment.
Based on the feature radius $R$ there we place junctions along the unmarked bones following the beading strategy.

\label{heterogeneous_joint_generation}
\end{figure}





\subsubsection{Toolpath extraction algorithm}
After the beading strategy has been applied we have a beading associated with each marked node as well as each node with locally maximal $R$.
In order to determine the junction locations of trapezoids which don't contain any such node, we propagate the beading information down.
We therefore sort all trapezoids on their highest $R$-value and process the high $R$ trapezoids first.
The beading information is then passed down along the bones of the trapezoid to lower $R$ nodes if those nodes don't already have a beading associated.

See \cref{alg_beading_propagation}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Beading propagation}
\label{alg_beading_propagation}
\begin{algorithmic}
\State trapezoids.sortOn(getHighestR())
\ForAll{$q \in$ trapezoids}
	\State $v_\text{max} = q$.getHighestR()
	\State beading = retrieveBeading($v_\text{max}$)
	\If {$\neg$ retrieveBeading($v_\text{max}$.next())}
		\State storeBeading($v_\text{max}$.next(), beading)
	\EndIf
	\If {$\neg$ retrieveBeading($v_\text{max}$.prev())}
		\State storeBeading($v_\text{max}$.prev(), beading)
	\EndIf
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


We can then process all bones in arbitrary order and generate the junctions along those bones.
See \cref{alg_junction_generation}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Junction generation}
\label{alg_junction_generation}
\lstset{language=C++}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
Point a = edge->to->p;
Point b = edge->from->p;
Point ab = b - a;

int start_R = edge->to->data.distance_to_boundary; // higher R
int end_R = edge->from->data.distance_to_boundary; // lower R
assert(end_R <= start_R);

int junction_idx;
// compute starting junction_idx for this segment
for (junction_idx = (beading->toolpath_locations.size() - 1) / 2; junction_idx >= 0 && junction_idx < beading->toolpath_locations.size(); junction_idx--)
{
  int bead_R = beading->toolpath_locations[junction_idx];
  if (bead_R <= start_R)
    break; // junction coinciding with start node is used in this function call
}

for (; junction_idx >= 0 && junction_idx < coord_t(beading->toolpath_locations.size()); junction_idx--)
{
  int bead_R = beading->toolpath_locations[junction_idx];
  assert(bead_R > 0);
  if (bead_R < end_R)
    break; // junction coinciding with a node is handled by the next segment
  
  Point junction(a + ab * (bead_R - start_R) / (end_R - start_R));
  junctions.emplace_back(junction, beading->bead_widths[junction_idx], junction_idx);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{algorithm}


We then generate bead segments for each trapezoid by connecting together the junctions of the same index.
If the amount of junctions on both sides of the trapezoid is not the same then this trapezoid is in a transition and we leave one junction unconnected.


\paragraph{Printing order}
The order in which beads are printed has influence on the quality and dimensional accuracy of a print.
If the inner beads are printed first then small inaccuracies in the deposition process propagate outward and the final outline of the print layer will be less accurate.
However, if the second bead is printed before the outer bead then the outer bead has more material to adhere to, which lessens the overhang constraints.
We therefore choose to print the inner beads first starting from the second bead and at the very end print the outermost bead.

\label{single_bead_strategy}
\end{figure}

When all extrusion segments are generated, we combine them into semi-continuous polyline toolpaths.
These polylines generally form closed polygons, but at marked regions of the ST the toolpaths consist of single bead polyline toolpaths.
See \cref{single_bead_strategy}.
These single bead polylines can connect to polygonal toolpaths and they can also meet each other at 3-way junctions.
We determine the printing order for all segments of a given bead index by minimizing the travel distance using a greedy path order optimizer.
\todo{[implementation needed!]}


In general the toolpath location should be centered on the middle of the bead.
However, when the bead width is smaller than the nozzle size we might want to offset the toolpath toward a previously printed bead.
That way the previously printed bead occludes part of the hole in the nozzle such that the unoccluded hole is as wide as the required bead width.
The printing order and the toolpath positioning of the beading strategy are therefore interrelated.

Around 3-way junctions we need to prevent overextrusion.
We need to reduce the extrusion amount after the first time we pass an intersection: commonly known as \emph{ghosting}.
See \cref{ghosting}.
In order to realize the reduction we remove a section from the extrusion bead up to a distance equal to the feature radius from the junction.
