abstract = "Recent interior carving methods for functional design necessitate a cumbersome cut-and-glue process in fabrication. We propose a method to generate interior voids which not only satisfy the functional purposes but are also support-free during the 3D printing process. We introduce a support-free unit structure for voxelization and derive the wall thicknesses parametrization for continuous optimization. We also design a discrete dithering algorithm to ensure the printability of ghost voxels. The interior voids are iteratively carved by alternating the optimization and dithering. We apply our method to optimize the static and rotational stability, and print various results to evaluate the efficacy."

Finally, parametric analyses reveal influences of some key parameters on the local buckling stress and strength-to-density ratio; meanwhile the constitutive behaviors and energy-absorption properties, with increasing hierarchy n, are calculated. The results show the possibility to tailor the elastic buckling properties at each hierarchical level, and could thus have interesting applications, e.g., in the design of multiscale energy-absorption honeycomb light materials. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {We investigated the mechanical behavior of two-dimensional hierarchical honeycomb structures using analytical, numerical and experimental methods. Hierarchical honeycombs were constructed by replacing every three-edge vertex of a regular hexagonal lattice with a smaller hexagon. Repeating this process builds a fractal-appearing structure. The resulting isotropic in-plane elastic properties (effective elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio) of this structure are controlled by the dimension ratios for different hierarchical orders. Hierarchical honeycombs of first and second order can be up to 2.0 and 3.5 times stiffer than regular honeycomb at the same mass (i.e., same overall average density). The Poisson's ratio varies from nearly 1.0 (when planar 'bulk' modulus is considerably greater than Young's modulus, so the structure acts 'incompressible' for most loadings) to 0.28, depending on the dimension ratios. The work provides insight into the role of structural organization and hierarchy in regulating the mechanical behavior of materials, and new opportunities for developing low-weight cellular structures with tailorable properties. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The in-plane dynamic crushing of two dimensional honeycombs with both regular hexagonal and irregular arrangements was investigated using detailed finite element models. The energy absorption of honeycombs made of a linear elastic-perfectly plastic material with constant and functionally graded density were estimated up to large crushing strains. Our numerical simulations showed three distinct crushing modes for honeycombs with a constant relative density: quasi-static, transition and dynamic. Moreover, irregular cellular structures showed to have energy absorption similar to their counterpart regular honeycombs of same relative density and mass. To study the dynamic crushing of functionally graded cellular structures, a density gradient in the direction of crushing was introduced in the computational models by a gradual change of the cell wall thickness. Decreasing the relative density in the direction of crushing was shown to enhance the energy absorption of honeycombs at early stages of crushing. The study provides new insight into the behavior of engineered and biological cellular materials, and could be used to develop novel energy absorbent structures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The cores are used to manufacture sandwich panels for flatwise compression and edgewise loading. The compressive modulus and compressive strength of stabilized (sandwich) honeycombs are found to be higher than those of bare honeycombs, and with density-averaged properties enhanced compared to other sandwich panels offered in the market place. The modulus and strength of graded sandwich panel under quasi-static edgewise loading vary with different failure mode mechanisms, and offer also improvements towards available panels from open literature. Edgewise impact loading shows a strong directionality of the mechanical response. When the indenter impacts the auxetic portion of the graded core, the strong localization of the damage due to the negative Poisson's ratio effect contains significantly the maximum dynamic displacement of the sandwich panel. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) enables the production of geometrically complex parts that are difficult to manufacture by other means. However, conventional CAD systems are limited in the representation of such parts. This issue is exacerbated when lattice structures are combined or embedded within a complex geometry. This paper presents a computationally efficient, voxel-based method of generating lattices comprised of practically any cell type that can conform to an arbitrary external geometry. The method of conforming involves the tessellation and trimming of unit cells that can leave ‘hanging' struts at the surface, which is a possible point of weakness in the structure. A method of joining these struts to form an external two dimensional lattice, termed a ‘net-skin' is also described. Traditional methods of manufacturing lattice structures generally do not allow variation of cell properties within a structure; however, additive manufacturing enables graded lattices to be generated that are potentially more optimal. A method of functionally grading lattices is, therefore, also described to take advantage of this manufacturing capability.},

This study aims to explore the mechanical properties of functionally graded lattice structures fabricated by an additive manufacturing technique namely, selective laser melting (SLM), with Ti-6Al-4V as the building material. Both cubic lattice and honeycomb lattice structures with varied strut diameter and density were designed and manufactured, and their physical characteristics, deformation behavior and compressive properties were investigated. The collapse of structure always started from least dense layer to the denser layers. In contrast, samples with uniform density showed abrupt shear failure with diagonal cracking across the whole structure. The plateau stress and specific energy absorption of density graded samples were higher than for uniform density samples for three out of four designs by up to 67{\%} and 72{\%}, respectively. In addition, density graded lattices showed distinct energy absorption behavior with cumulative energy absorption increasing as a power of strain function while uniform density lattices showed a near-linear relationship.},

abstract = {Fused filament fabrication of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) offers a capability to manufacture tailorable, flexible honeycomb structures which can be optimised for energy absorbing applications. This work explores the effect of a range of grading methodologies on the energy absorbing and damping behaviour of flexible TPU honeycomb structures. By applying density grading, the energy absorbing and damping profiles are significantly modified from the uniform density equivalent. A 3D-printing procedure was developed which allowed the manufacture of high-quality structures, which underwent cyclic loading to densification without failure. Graded honeycomb architectures had an average relative density of 0.375 ± 0.05. After quasi-static testing, arrays were subjected to sinusoidal compression over a range of amplitudes at 0.5 Hz. By grading the structural density in different ways, mechanical damping was modified. Cyclic compressive testing also showed how strain-softening of the TPU parent material could lead to reduced damping over the course of 50 cycles. Samples were subjected to impact loading at strain-rates of up to 51 s-1 and specific impact energies of up to 270 mJ/cm3. Lower peak loads were transferred for graded samples for the most severe impact cases. This behaviour reveals the potential of density grading of TPU structures to provide superior impact protection in extreme environmental conditions.},

Four types of graded cellular structures, based on grading orientations along radial and longitudinal planes, were manufactured using selective laser melting techniques. The cellular structures in this study have the mechanical properties (E = 2.3–3.1 GPa, $\sigma$ = 113–523 MPa) compatible with bone structures. Grading a porosity of the CoCr cellular structures provides a greater stress transfer to the proximal peri-implant area.

A widely used practice to fabricate such models is by layer-based additive manufacturing (AM), which however suffers from the problem of adding and removing interior supporting structures. In this paper, we present a novel method for generating application-specific infill structures on rhombic cells so that the resultant structures can automatically satisfy manufacturing requirements on overhang-angle and wall-thickness. Additional supporting structures can be avoided entirely in our framework. To achieve this, we introduce the usage of an adaptive rhombic grid, which is built from an input surface model. Starting from the initial sparse set of rhombic cells, via numerical optimization techniques an objective function can be improved by adaptively subdividing the rhombic grid and thus adding more walls in cells. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for generating interior designs in the applications of improving mechanical stiffness and static stability.},

abstract = {Three areas, where polymer foam products are used in personal protection, are reviewed to contrast the foam micromechanisms and the use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for engineering design. For flexible open-cell foams used for seating cushions, the main deformation mechanism is cell edge bending; regular cell models can predict much of the compressive response. Hyperelastic FEA models can then predict the forces for foam indentation. For flexible closed-cell foams used in shoe midsoles, cell air compression dominates the response; diffusive air loss leads to foam deterioration with use. Hyperelastic FEA models can predict the interaction between the foam and the heelpad. Finally, for rigid closed-cell foams used in helmets, the permanent stretching and wrinkling of cell faces dominates the response. Crushable foam FEA models, which consider the yield surface and hardening, predict different responses for impacts on the road and on a kerbstone. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The mechanical properties at room temperature of three polymeric foams (namely EPP, PUR and PS/PA foams) have been experimentally evaluated in both static and impact loading conditions. The energy absorption characteristics have been examined both through the energy-absorption diagram method and through the efficiency diagram method. The meaning of the efficiency parameter, already used in the literature, has been explained in a proper, satisfactory way. It is shown that the maximum of the efficiency identifies the condition for optimal energy absorption of the foam, while the maximum stress reaches a value limited through other design considerations. The efficiency diagram method is then used to obtain synthetic diagrams useful to characterize the material and to help the design of energy absorbing components. These synthetic selection diagrams are obtained for the three tested materials. Finally, some consideration are drawn comparing the mechanical performance of the three considered types of foams and their dependency on density. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring about a revolution in the way products are designed, manufactured, and distributed to end users. This technology has gained significant academic as well as industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties. AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example materials processing, topology optimization) generate a "positive feedback loop" effect in advancing AM. In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings, and future trends significantly to the researchers. We also discuss fundamental attributes of AM processes, evolution of the AM industry, and the affordances enabled by the emergence of AM in a variety of areas such as geometry processing, material design, and education. We conclude our paper by pointing out future directions such as the "print-it-all" paradigm, that have the potential to re-imagine current research and spawn completely new avenues for exploration.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing is a process by which a three dimensional object is created layer after layer, through selective deposition of material. It often requires the automated generation of auxiliary shapes, to temporarily support the object, to protect its surface, or to carve inner cavities and reduce material usage. In this context, we define a printable enclosure as a minimal volume enclosing a given shape and whose boundary can be printed at the smallest possible thickness while ensuring proper bonding between layers. Such an enclosure is well suited to serve as auxiliary structure for additive manufacturing: it is easy to print and require little material. In this paper, we demonstrate its use on three different applications: enclosing a print within protective walls that are close to the surface; generating large inner cavities whose walls are printable, and finally modeling support structures that provide a dense support to the downward facing surfaces while vanishing as quickly as possible below the supported object. We obtain the shape of an enclosure by considering constraints on its set of slices along horizontal planes. In practice, the set of slices is discrete and the constraints afford for an efficient sweep-like construction algorithm using morphological operations on the slices. We discuss the printability and optimality of the enclosures and their boundary walls.},

Design/methodology/approach Three geometric variables (inclination, included and incidence angle) were defined for an edge. The influence of each variable on the geometric errors was explained with reference to specific causes related to physical phenomena and process constraints. Findings Occurrence conditions for all causes were determined and visualized in a process map, which was also developed into a software procedure for the diagnosis of quality issues on digital models of the parts. Research limitations/implications The process map was developed by only empirical considerations and does not allow to predict the amount of geometric errors. In the second part of the paper, experimental tests will help to extend and validate the prediction criteria. Practical implications As demonstrated by an example, the results allow to predict the occurrence of visible defects on the edges of a part before manufacturing it with a given build orientation. Originality/value In literature, the geometric accuracy of additively manufactured parts is only related to surface features. The paper shows that the quality of edges depends on additional variables and causes to be carefully controlled by process choices.},

Despite the associated opportunities for innovation, the use of support material also introduces a series of limitations: additional material cost, cost of removal of support material, potential contamination of biocompatible materials, and entrapment of support material within cellular structures. This work presents a strategy for minimising the use of support material by comparing the geometric limits of an additive manufacture process to the build angles that exist within a proposed geometry. This method generates a feasibility map of the feasible build orientations for a proposed geometry with a given process. The method is applied to polyhedra that are suitable for close packing to identify space-filling tessellated structures that can be selfsupporting. The integrity of an FDM process is quantified, and using the associated feasibility map, self-supporting polyhedra are manufactured. These polyhedra are integrated with non-trivial geometries to achieve a reduction in consumed material of approximately 50{\%}. {\textcopyright} (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Additively manufactured parts are often composed of two sub-structures, a solid shell forming their exterior and a porous infill occupying the interior. To account for this feature this paper presents a novel method for generating simultaneously optimized shell and infill in the context of minimum compliance topology optimization. Our method builds upon two recently developed approaches that extend density-based topology optimization: A coating approach to obtain an optimized shell that is filled uniformly with a prescribed porous base material, and an infill approach which generates optimized, non-uniform infill within a prescribed shell. To evolve the shell and infill concurrently, our formulation assigns two sets of design variables: One set defines the base and the coating, while the other set defines the infill structures. The resulting intermediate density distributions are unified by a material interpolation model into a physical density field, upon which the compliance is minimized. Enhanced by an adapted robust formulation for controlling the minimum length scale of the base, our method generates optimized shell–infill composites suitable for additive manufacturing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on numerical examples, and analyse the influence of different design specifications.},

abstract = {One crucial component of the additive manufacturing software toolchain is a class of geometric algorithms known as “slicers.” The purpose of the slicer is to compute a parametric toolpath and associated commands, which direct an additive manufacturing system to produce a physical realization of a three-dimensional input model. Existing slicing algorithms operate by application of geometric transformations upon the input geometry in order to produce the toolpath. In this paper we introduce a new implicit slicing algorithm based on the computation of toolpaths derived from the level sets of arbitrary heuristics-based or physics-based fields defined over the input geometry. This enables computationally efficient slicing of arbitrarily complex geometries in a straight forward fashion. Additionally, the calculation of component “infill” (as a process control parameter) is explored due to its crucial effect on functional performance fields of interest such as strain and stress distributions. Several examples of the application of the proposed implicit slicer are presented. Finally, an example demonstrating improved structural performance during physical testing is presented. We conclude with remarks regarding the strengths of the implicit approach relative to existing explicit approaches, and discuss future work required in order to extend the methodology.},

abstract = {Topology optimization is a technique that allows for increasingly efficient designs with minimal a priori decisions. Because of the complexity and intricacy of the solutions obtained, topology optimization was often constrained to research and theoretical studies. Additive manufacturing, a rapidly evolving field, fills the gap between topology optimization and application. Additive manufacturing has minimal limitations on the shape and complexity of the design, and is currently evolving towards new materials, higher precision and larger build sizes. Two topology optimization methods are addressed: the ground structure method and density-based topology optimization. The results obtained from these topology optimization methods require some degree of post-processing before they can be manufactured. A simple procedure is described by which output suitable for additive manufacturing can be generated. In this process, some inherent issues of the optimization technique may be magnified resulting in an unfeasible or bad product. In addition, this work aims to address some of these issues and propose methodologies by which they may be alleviated. The proposed framework has applications in a number of fields, with specific examples given from the fields of health, architecture and engineering. In addition, the generated output allows for simple communication, editing, and combination of the results into more complex designs. For the specific case of three-dimensional density-based topology optimization, a tool suitable for result inspection and generation of additive manufacturing output is also provided.},

abstract = {Several techniques exist to automatically synthesize a 2D image resembling an input exemplar texture. Most of the approaches op- timize a new image so that the color neighborhoods in the output closely match those in the input, across all scales. In this paper we revisit by-example texture synthesis in the context of additive man- ufacturing. Our goal is to generate not only colors, but also struc- ture along output surfaces: given an exemplar indicating 'solid' and 'empty' pixels, we generate a similar pattern along the output sur- face. The core challenge is to guarantee that the pattern is not only fully connected, but also structurally sound. To achieve this goal we propose a novel formulation for on-surface by-example texture synthesis that directly works in a voxel shell around the surface. It enables efficient local updates to the pattern, letting our structural optimizer perform changes that improve the overall rigidity of the pattern.We use this technique in an iterative scheme that jointly optimizes for appearance and structural sound- ness.We consider fabricability constraints and a user-provided de- scription of a force profile that the object has to resist. Our results fully exploit the capabilities of additive manufacturing by letting users design intricate structures along surfaces. The struc- tures are complex, yet they resemble input exemplars, resulting in a modeling tool accessible to casual users.},

abstract = {Filament fused fabrication is the method of choice for printing 3D models at low cost, and is the de-facto standard for hobbyists, makers and schools. Unfortunately, filament printers cannot truly reproduce colored objects. The best current techniques rely on a form of dithering exploiting occlusion, that was only demonstrated for shades of two base colors and that behaves differently depending on surface slope. We explore a novel approach for 3D printing colored objects, capable of creating controlled gradients of varying sharpness. Our technique exploits off-the-shelves nozzles that are designed to mix multiple filaments in a small melting chamber, obtaining intermediate colors once the mix is stabilized. We exploit this property to produce color gradients. We divide each input layer into a set of sublayers, each having a different constant color. By locally changing the thickness of the sublayers, we change the color that is perceived at a given location. By optimizing the choice of colors of each sublayer, we further improve quality and allow the use of different numbers of input filaments. We demonstrate our results by building a functional color printer using low cost, off-the-shelves components. Using our tool a user can paint a 3D model and directly produce its physical counterpart, using any material and color available for fused filament fabrication.},

abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication is an additive manufacturing process by which a 3D object is created from plastic filament. The filament is pushed through a hot nozzle where it melts. The nozzle deposits plastic layer after layer to create the final object. This process has been popularized by the RepRap community. Several printers feature multiple extruders, allowing objects to be formed from multiple materials or colors. The extruders are mounted side by side on the printer carriage. However, the print quality suffers when objects with color patterns are printed - a disappointment for designers interested in 3D printing their colored digital models. The most severe issue is the oozing of plastic from the idle extruders: Plastics of different colors bleed onto each other giving the surface a smudged aspect, excess strings oozing from the extruder deposit on the surface, and holes appear due to this missing plastic. Fixing this issue is difficult: increasing the printing speed reduces oozing but also degrades surface quality - on large prints the required speed level become impractical. Adding a physical mechanism increases cost and print time as extruders travel to a cleaning station. Instead, we rely on software and exploit degrees of freedom of the printing process. We introduce three techniques that complement each other in improving the print quality significantly. We first reduce the impact of oozing plastic by choosing a better azimuth angle for the printed part. We build a disposable rampart in close proximity of the part, giving the extruders the opportunity to wipe oozing strings and refill with hot plastic. We finally introduce a toolpath planner avoiding and hiding most of the defects due to oozing, and seamlessly integrating the rampart. We demonstrate our technique on several challenging multiple color prints, and show that our tool path planner improves the surface finish of single color prints as well. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum {\textcopyright} 2014 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.

abstract = {We develop a new kind of “space-filling” curves, connected Fer- mat spirals, and show their compelling properties as a tool path fill pattern for layered fabrication. Unlike classical space-filling curves such as the Peano or Hilbert curves, which constantly wind and bind to preserve locality, connected Fermat spirals are formed mostly by long, low-curvature paths. This geometric property, along with continuity, influences the quality and efficiency of layered fabrica- tion. Given a connected 2D region, we first decompose it into a set of sub-regions, each of which can be filled with a single continuous Fermat spiral. We show that it is always possible to start and end a Fermat spiral fill at approximately the same location on the outer boundary of the filled region. This special property allows the Fer- mat spiral fills to be joined systematically along a graph traversal of the decomposed sub-regions. The result is a globally continuous curve. We demonstrate that printing 2D layers following tool paths as connected Fermat spirals leads to efficient and quality fabrica- tion, compared to conventional fill patterns.},

abstract = {We present a novel continuous optimization method to the discrete problem of quadtree optimization. The optimization aims at achieving a quadtree structure with the highest mechanical stiffness, where the edges in the quadtree are interpreted as structural elements carrying mechanical loads. We formulate quadtree optimization as a continuous material distribution problem. The discrete design variables (i.e., to refine or not to refine) are replaced by continuous variables on multiple levels in the quadtree hierarchy. In discrete quadtree optimization, a cell is only eligible for refinement if its parent cell has been refined. We propose a continuous analogue to this dependency for continuous multi-level design variables, and integrate it in the iterative optimization process. Our results show that the continuously optimized quadtree structures perform much stiffer than uniform patterns and the heuristically optimized counterparts. We demonstrate the use of adaptive structures as lightweight infill for 3D printed parts, where uniform geometric patterns have been typically used in practice.},

abstract = {Purpose To discuss the problem of the geometric accuracy of edges in parts manufactured by the FDM process, as a preliminary step for an experimental investigation. Design/methodology/approach Three geometric variables (inclination, included and incidence angle) were defined for an edge. The influence of each variable on the geometric errors was explained with reference to specific causes related to physical phenomena and process constraints. Findings Occurrence conditions for all causes were determined and visualized in a process map, which was also developed into a software procedure for the diagnosis of quality issues on digital models of the parts. Research limitations/implications The process map was developed by only empirical considerations and does not allow to predict the amount of geometric errors. In the second part of the paper, experimental tests will help to extend and validate the prediction criteria. Practical implications As demonstrated by an example, the results allow to predict the occurrence of visible defects on the edges of a part before manufacturing it with a given build orientation. Originality/value In literature, the geometric accuracy of additively manufactured parts is only related to surface features. The paper shows that the quality of edges depends on additional variables and causes to be carefully controlled by process choices.},

Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review of the literature focusing on process design and mathematical process modeling was carried out. Findings - FDM and similar processes are among the most widely used rapid prototyping processes with growing application in finished part manufacturing. Key elements of the typical processes, including the material feed mechanism, liquefier and print nozzle; the build surface and environment; and approaches to part finishing are described. Approaches to estimating the motor torque and power required to achieve a desired filament feed rate are presented. Models of required heat flux, shear on the melt and pressure drop in the liquefier are reviewed. On leaving the print nozzle, die swelling and bead cooling are considered. Approaches to modeling the spread of a deposited road of material and the bonding of polymer roads to one another are also reviewed. Originality/value - To date, no other systematic review of process design and modeling research related to melt extrusion AM has been published. Understanding and improving process models will be key to improving system process controls, as well as enabling the development of advanced engineering material feedstocks for FDM processes.},

This work presents halftoning techniques to manufacture 3D objects with the appearance of full grayscale imagery for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers. While droplet-based dithering is a common halftoning technique, this is not applicable to FDM printing, since FDM builds up objects by extruding material in semi-continuous paths. A set of three methods is presented which apply a linear halftoning principle called 'hatching' to horizontal, vertical and diagonal surfaces. These methods are better suited to FDM compared to other halftoning methods: their applicability stands irrespective of the geometry and surface slope and the perceived tone is less sensitive to the viewing angle. Furthermore, the methods have little effect on printing time. Experiments on a dual-nozzle FDM printer show promising results. Future work is required to optimize the interaction between the presented methods.},

The aim of the Design for Additive Manufacturing is to provide design opportunities and to enhance workpiece properties taking into account constraints of the process, e.g. kinematics and limitations of print technology. Most AM applications are constrained to three-axis movements limiting the fabrication of workpieces layer by layer to one fixed building direction only. This causes limitations of strength properties, surface quality and the need of supporting structures. Multi-axis AM enables completely new design possibilities going beyond current optimization and design strategies of conventional AM workpieces. This innovation requires multiple design and manufacturing changes in the internal and external geometry of the workpiece as well as in machine and printing head technology. This paper identifies the requirements and capabilities of multi-axis AM and presents possible solutions to overcome the identified challenges. Preliminary results for multi-axis AM are described on an exemplary workpiece.},

abstract = {The potential of topology optimization to amplify the benefits of additive manufacturing (AM), by fully exploiting the vast design space that AM allows, is widely recognized. However, existing topology optimization approaches do not consider AM-specific limitations during the design process, resulting in designs that are not self-supporting. This leads to additional effort and costs in post-processing and use of sacrificial support structures. To overcome this difficulty, this paper presents a topology optimization formulation that includes a simplified AM fabrication model implemented as a layerwise filtering procedure. Unprintable geometries are effectively excluded from the design space, resulting in fully self-supporting optimized designs. The procedure is demonstrated on numerical examples involving compliance minimization, eigenfrequency maximization and compliant mechanism design. Despite the applied restrictions, in suitable orientations fully printable AM-restrained designs matched the performance of reference designs obtained by conventional topology optimization.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a general mathematic approach to model the microstructures of porous structures produced by additive manufacturing (AM), which will result in fractal surface topography and higher roughness that have greater influence on the performance of porous structures. Design/methodology/approach - The overall shapes of pores were modeled by triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS), and the micro-roughness details attached to the overall pore shapes were represented by Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (W-M) fractal representation, which was integrated with TPMS along its normal vectors. An index roughly reflecting the irregularity of fractal TPMS was proposed, based on which the influence of the fractal parameters on the fractal TPMS was qualitatively analyzed. Two complex samples of real porous structures were given to demonstrate the feasibility of the model. Findings - The fractal surface topography should not be neglected at a micro-scale level. In addition, a decrease in the fractal dimension Ds may exponentially make the topography rougher; an increase in the height-scaling parameter G may linearly increase the roughness; and the number of the superposed ridges has no distinct influence on the topography. Furthermore, the synthesis method is general for all implicit surfaces. Practical implications - The method provides an alternative way to shift the posteriori design paradigm of porous media to priori design mode through numeric simulation. Therefore, the optimization of AM process parameters, as well as the porous structure, can be potentially realized according to specific functional requirement. Originality/value - The synthesis of TPMS and W-M fractal geometry was accomplished efficiently and was general for all implicit freeform surfaces, and the influence of the fractal parameters on the fractal TPMS was analyzed more systematically. {\textcopyright} Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) professionals often throw around the notion that complexity is free. Indeed, complexity is much easier and potentially cheaper to achieve through AM than through traditional manufacturing, but it is not free. Upon attempting to manufacture complex designs, it is quickly found that certain features, or topologies, are more manufacturable than others, with sacrificial support material required for many complex designs. This will significantly increase machining costs. Topology Optimization (TO) is a freeform computational design methodology which is ideal for designing lightweight structures through a combination of modeling and rigorous optimization. While AM can realize many complex topologies, there still remain AM manufacturing limitations (such as overhangs), which require customized TO design algorithms beyond freeform TO. In this work, a projection-based TO methodology is presented to design for 3D self-supporting structures – i.e. structures that do not require sacrificial support material. The foundation of the presented methodology is a 2D overhang projection framework. In addition to expanding the methodology to three dimensions, the algorithm is drastically improved through (1) adopting a new overhang mapping scheme which allows for exact specification of allowable overhang angle, and (2) implementing an adjoint approach to sensitivity calculations to speed up calculation drastically and to allow for scalability. Using several examples, it is shown that the presented methodology generates self-supporting structures (given a prescribed printable overhang angle) which are entirely manufacturable without any added sacrificial support material. Upon printing a couple topologies with mixed success, further customization of the algorithm is proposed for situations where multiple directional-dependent overhang angles are possible in a single AM system.},

abstract = {Lattice structures with different desired physical properties are promising for a broad spectrum of applications. The availability of additive manufacturing (AM) technology has relaxed the fabricating limitation of lattice structures. However, manufacturing constraints still exist for AM-fabricated lattice structures, which have a significant influence on the printing quality and mechanical properties of lattice struts. In this paper, a design and optimization strategy is proposed for lattice structures with the consideration of manufacturability to ensure desired printing quality. The concept of manufacturable element is used to link the design and manufacturing process. A meta-model is constructed by experiments and the artificial neural network to obtain the manufacturing constraints. Sizes of struts are optimized by a bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization-based algorithm with these manufacturing constraints. An arm of quadcopter is redesigned and optimized to validate the proposed method. Its result shows that optimized heterogeneous lattice structures can improve the stiffness of the model compared to the homogeneous lattice structure and the original design. Both the Von-Mises stress and the maximum displacement are reduced without increasing the weight of designed part. And by considering the manufacturability constraints, the optimized design has been successfully fabricated by the selected additive manufacturing process.},

In this work, we present a novel optimization strategy for designing functionally graded cellular structures with desired mechanical properties. This approach is mainly by generating variable-density gyroid structure and then performing graded structure optimization. Firstly, the geometric properties of the original gyroid structures are analyzed, and the continuity and connectivity of the structures are optimized by adding a penalty function. Then, a homogenization method is used to obtain mechanical properties of gyroid-based cellular structures through a scaling law as a function of their relative densities. Secondly, the scaling law is added directly into the structure optimization algorithm to compute the optimal density distribution in part being optimized. Thirdly, the density mapping and interpolation approach are used to map the output of structure optimization into the parametric gyroid structure which results in an optimum lightweight lattice structure with uniformly varying densities across the design space. Lastly, the effectiveness and robustness of the optimized results are analyzed through finite element analysis and experiments.},

Next, Oc{\'{e}} High Resolution 3D printing technology was used to create samples with spatially varying gloss.

abstract = {Man and nature both exploit the remarkable properties of cellular solids, by which we mean foams, meshes and microlattices. To the non-scientist, their image is that of soft, compliant, things: cushions, packaging and padding. To the food scientist they are familiar as bread, cake and desserts of the best kind: meringue, mousse and sponge. To those who study nature they are the structural materials of their subject: wood, coral, cancellous bone. And to the engineer they are of vast importance in building lightweight structures, for energy management, for thermal insulation, filtration and much more. When a solid is converted into a material with a foam-like structure, the single-valued properties of the solid are extended. By properties we mean stiffness, strength, thermal conductivity and diffusivity, electrical resistivity and so forth. And the extension is vast-the properties can be changed by a factor of 1000 or more. Perhaps the most important concept in analysing the mechanical behaviour is that of the distinction between a stretch- and a bending-dominated structure. The first is exceptionally stiff and strong for a given mass; the second is compliant and, although not strong, it absorbs energy well when compressed. This paper summarizes a little of the way in which the mechanical properties of cellular solids are analysed and illustrates the range of properties offered by alternative configurations.},

abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) technology can manufacture complex lattice structures, which effectively reduces the manufacturing constraint and significantly increases the design freedom for lattice structure. In this study, additive manufacturing and topology optimization are combined for designing Face Centre Cube (FCC), Vertex Cube (VC), and Edge Centre Cube (ECC) structures, which are manufactured via SLM technology. Mechanical performance is evaluated, and a Gibson-Ashby model is developed to predict the performance of the three structures including different levels of porosity. The results show that FCC and VC lattice structures have better mechanical behaviour compared with that of the ECC lattice structure; however, their energy absorption efficiency is inferior to that of the ECC lattice structure. Comparisons between various SLM built lattice structures made from 316L stainless steel prove that the performance of topology-optimized lattice structures is superior to the majority of lattice structures. This result verifies the feasibility of lattice structure unit selection via topology optimization technology. Various work conditions are simulated for topology optimization to obtain a lightweight lattice structure with optimal performance under specific conditions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a level set-based topology optimization method considering the overhang constraint in additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Though the combination of the topology optimization and AM shows a promising potential and high design flexibility, there are still certain limitations. The overhang constraint is one of the major issues that need to be considered in the design stage. It requires the inclination angles of structural downward-facing surfaces to be larger than a given lower bound, so as to prevent the structure from warping or collapsing during the AM process. We propose a new form of overhang constraint in the level set framework, which is expressed as a single domain integral instead of point-wise constraints. This domain integral form facilitates the detection of overhang constraint violation. The shape derivative of the overhang constraint is derived by using the signed distance property of the level set function. The proposed method is capable of dealing with constraints with different minimum overhang angles. Theoretically, it allows the optimization to proceed from an arbitrary structural layout, without the need to satisfy the overhang constraint in the initial design. Several numerical examples are given to show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. It is seen in these examples that the overhang constraint is satisfied mainly by adjusting the local shape of structural members violating the overhang constraint during the optimization process. Thus, the overhang angle constrained optimization can generate similar load paths as in conventional optimal designs in most cases, without significantly worsening the structural stiffness.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method to design the periodic microstructure of a material to obtain prescribed constitutive properties. The microstructure is modelled as a truss or thin frame structure in 2 and 3 dimensions. The problem of finding the simplest possible microstructure with the prescribed elastic properties can be called an inverse homogenization problem, and is formulated as an optimization problem of finding a microstructure with the lowest possible weight which fulfils the specified behavioral requirements. A full ground structure known from topology optimization of trusses is used as starting guess for the optimization algorithm. This implies that the optimal microstructure of a base cell is found from a truss or frame structure with 120 possible members in the 2-dimensional case and 2016 possible members in the 3-dimensional case. The material parameters are found by a numerical homogenization method, using Finite-Elements to model the representative base cell, and the optimization problem is solved by an optimality criteria method. Numerical examples in two and three dimensions show that it is possible to design materials with many different properties using base cells modelled as truss or frame works. Hereunder is shown that it is possible to tailor extreme materials, such as isotropic materials with Poisson's ratio close to - 1, 0 and 0.5, by the proposed method. Some of the proposed materials have been tested as macro models which demonstrate the expected behaviour. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

We build on work in the area of meta- materials, using numerical optimization to design tiled microstruc- tures with desired properties, but with the key difference that our method designs families of related structures that can be interpo- lated to smoothly vary the material properties over a wide range. To create an object with spatially varying elastic properties, we tile the object's interior with microstructures drawn from these families, generating a different microstructure for each cell using an efficient algorithm to select compatible structures for neighboring cells. We show results computed for both 2D and 3D objects, validating sev- eral 2D and 3D printed structures using standard material tests as well as demonstrating various example applications.},

abstract = {The viability of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) as an Additive Manufacturing (AM) method is improved by including discrete carbon fibers in the polymer feedstock. The resulting carbon fiber polymer composite enhances mechanical and thermal properties, where improvements are directly related to the orientation of the carbon fibers within the extruded polymer composite. Fiber orientation in the polymer melt is affected by the flow field which is defined by the melt flow geometry including flow in the nozzle convergence and extrudate swell. This paper presents a computational approach for modeling the polymer melt flow and the associated effects of nozzle geometry and extrudate swell on fiber orientation in the extruded polymer. The finite element method is used to evaluate Stokes flow in the axisymmetric flow field of an FFF nozzle. Fiber orientation tensors are calculated throughout the fluid domain using the Orthotropic Fitted Closure and the Folgar-Tucker isotropic fiber interaction model. The radial and axial modulus of the extruded polymer is then calculated from fiber orientation tensors within the composite at the nozzle exit. Fiber orientation along the extrudate axis is shown to increase due to elongation flow within the nozzle convergence zone and decrease in the extrudate swell such that the modulus of elasticity of the extruded polymer is moderately affected by extrudate swell and substantially affected by the nozzle geometry.},

abstract = {This original work proposes to investigate the transposition of crystallography rules to cubic lattice architectured materials to generate new 3D porous structures. The application of symmetry operations provides a complete and convenient way to configure the lattice architecture with only two parameters. New lattice structures were created by slipping from the conventional Bravais lattice toward non-compact complex structures. The resulting stiffness of the porous materials was thoroughly evaluated for all the combinations of architecture parameters. This exhaustive study revealed attractive structures having high specific stiffness, up to twice as large as the usual octet-truss for a given relative density. It results in a relationship between effective Young modulus and relative density for any lattice structure. It also revealed the opportunity to generate auxetic structures at will, with a controlled Poisson ratio. The collection of the elastic properties for all the cubic structures into 3D maps provides a convenient tool for lattice materials design, for research, and for mechanical engineering. The resulting mechanical properties are highly variable according to architecture, and can be easily tailored for specific applications using the simple yet powerful formalism developed in this work.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies fabricate objects layer by layer, adding material on top of already solidified layers. A key challenge is to ensure that there is always something below the layer being fabricated: otherwise added material simply falls under the effect of gravity -- this is a critical issue with most technologies. 

This difficulty is typically treated differently for the interior and the exterior of an object: the exterior is supported through structures akin to scaffoldings that are removed afterwards, while the interior volume is filled with a sparse, self-supporting infill pattern. The infill acts as a support for the tops and also provides mechanical strength to the final print. However, as objects grow in size even sparse infills become prohibitively expensive in time and material usage, and if made too sparse they no longer provide the required support. This prevents printing large objects with empty interiors.

In this work we investigate how to compute as large as possible self-supporting empty cavities. Our technique is based on an iterated geometric carving algorithm, that is fast to compute and produces nested sets of inner walls. The walls have exactly the minimal printable thickness of the manufacturing process everywhere. Remarkably, our technique only manipulates two consecutive slices of the model at a time, sweeping through the model along the vertical direction, from top to bottom. 

We discuss an efficient, robust implementation in details, based on a filtered polygonal medial axis extraction and an exact polygon offsetting technique. 
Using our approach, we can print large parts on filament printers using as little as a single filament thickness, providing on order of magnitude reduction in print time and material use while $\backslash$textit{\{}guaranteeing{\}} printability.},

abstract = {Layered manufacturing inherently suffers from staircase defects along surfaces that are gently slopped with respect to the build direction. Reducing the slice thickness improves the situation but never resolves it completely as flat layers remain a poor approximation of the true surface in these regions. In addition, reducing the slice thickness largely increases the print time. In this work we focus on a simple yet effective technique to improve the print accuracy for layered manufacturing by filament deposition. Our method works with standard three-axis 3D filament printers (e.g. the typical, widely available 3D printers), using standard extrusion nozzles. It better reproduces the geometry of sloped surfaces without increasing the print time. Our key idea is to perform a local anti-aliasing, working at a sub-layer accuracy to produce slightly curved deposition paths and reduce approximation errors. This is inspired by Computer Graphics anti-aliasing techniques which consider sub-pixel precision to treat aliasing effects. We show that the necessary deviation in height compared to standard slicing is bounded by half the layer thickness. Therefore, the height changes remain small and plastic deposition remains reliable. We further split and order paths to minimize defects due to the extruder nozzle shape, avoiding any change to the existing hardware. We apply and analyze our approach on 3D printed examples, showing that our technique greatly improves surface accuracy and silhouette quality while keeping the print time nearly identical.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing is a process by which a three dimensional object is 
created layer after layer, through selective deposition of material.
It often requires the automated generation of auxiliary shapes, to temporarily 
support the object, to protect its surface, or to carve inner cavities and 
reduce material usage.

In this context, we define a ``printable enclosure'' as a minimal volume
enclosing a given shape and whose boundary can be printed at the smallest 
possible thickness while ensuring proper bonding between layers.
Such an enclosure is well suited to serve as auxiliary structure for additive 
manufacturing: it is easy to print and require little material. In this
paper, we demonstrate its use on three different applications: enclosing a
print within protective walls that are close to the surface; generating large
inner cavities whose walls are printable, and finally modeling support 
structures that provide a dense support to the downward facing surfaces while 
vanishing as quickly as possible below the supported object.

We obtain the shape of an enclosure by considering constraints on its set of slices along 
horizontal planes. In practice, the set of slices is discrete and the 
constraints afford for an efficient sweep-like construction algorithm using 
morphological operations on the slices. We discuss the printability and 
optimality of the enclosures and their boundary walls.},

abstract = {We introduce an interactive sculpting approach that enables modeling of support-free objects: objects which do not require any
support structures during 3D printing. We propose three operators – trim, preserve, grow – to maintain the support-free property
during interactive modeling. These operators let us define brushes that perform either in an unconstrained manner (adapting
the shape to the brush effect), or selectively discard changes inside the brush volume. Our technique can be applied to many
modeling operations and we demonstrate it on brushes for adding or removing matter. We describe an efficient implementation of
a voxel-based modeling tool that produces only support-free shapes, and show example shapes modeled within minutes},

abstract = {Decorative patterns are observed in many forms of art, typically enriching the visual aspect of otherwise simple shapes. Such patterns are especially difficult to create, as they often exhibit intricate structural details and at the same time have to precisely match the size and shape of the underlying geometry. In the field of Computer Graphics, several approaches have been proposed to automatically synthesize a decorative pattern along a curve, from an example. This empowers non expert users with a simple brush metaphor, allowing them to easily paint complex structured decorations.

We extend this idea to the space of design and fabrication. The major challenge is to properly account for the topology of the produced patterns. In particular, our technique ensures that synthesized patterns will be made of exactly one connected component, so that once printed they form a single object. To achieve this goal we propose a two steps synthesis process, first synthesizing the topology of the pattern and later synthesizing its exact geometry. We introduce topology descriptors that efficiently capture the topology of the pattern synthesized so far.

We propose several applications of our method, from designing objects using synthesized patterns along curves and within rectangles, to the decoration of surfaces with a dedicated smooth frame interpolation. Using our technique, designers paint structured patterns that can be fabricated into solid, tangible objects, creating unusual and surprising designs of lamps, chairs and laces from examples.},

abstract = {We propose an optimization framework for 3D printing that seeks to save printing time and the support material required to print 3D shapes. Three-dimensional printing technology is rapidly maturing and may revolutionize how we manufacture objects. The total cost of printing, however, is governed by numerous factors which include not only the price of the printer but also the amount of material and time to fabricate the shape. Our PackMerger framework converts the input 3D watertight mesh into a shell by hollowing its inner parts. The shell is then divided into segments. The location of splits is controlled based on several parameters, including the size of the connection areas or volume of each segment. The pieces are then tightly packed using optimization. The optimization attempts to minimize the amount of support material and the bounding box volume of the packed segments while keeping the number of segments minimal. The final packed configuration can be printed with substantial time and material savings, while also allowing printing of objects that would not fit into the printer volume. We have tested our system on three different printers and it shows a reduction of 5-30{\%} of the printing time while simultaneously saving 15-65{\%} of the support material. The optimization time was approximately 1 min. Once the segments are printed, they need to be assembled.},

abstract = {Many displays are basically bilevel in nature with individual display cells, all of the same size, arranged in a rectangular array. We present a survey of processing techniques for presenting continuous tone still images on such displays. Four techniques are covered in detail while several others are covered briefly. All the techniques achieve the subjective effect of continuous tone by properly controlling only the spatial density of bilevel display states. The processing techniques consist of dividing an image into picture elements and comparing the intensity of each element with a threshold value. If the element intensity is greater than the threshold, the corresponding display cell is set to the bright state; otherwise, the cell is set to the dark state. In the ordered-dither technique, the threshold is spatially dependent, i.e., it is determined only by the coordinates of the element being processed. In the remaining three techniques, constrained average, dynamic threshold, and minimized average error, the threshold is determined by values of elements close to the one currently being processed. The latter three thus require more processing and more storage than the first, but allow some edge emphasis. Images processed by all the described techniques are exhibited. {\textcopyright} 1976 Academic Press, Inc.},

Our tool aims at improving Chopper by providing users three easy-to-use interactive operations: no-go region painting, cutting plane specification and components re-union. With these operations, we show that (1) exhaustive search in the BSP tree ---the most time-consuming step in Chopper ---can be avoided, (2) more flexible geometric configurations can be provided, (3) user's design intention is considered naturally and efficiently, and customized 3D partitioning results can be obtained. We test our tool on a wide range of 3D models and observe promising results. A preliminary user study also demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency.},

We have validated our material measure- ment process by comparing simulations of arbitrary stacks of base materials with measured deformations of fabricated material stacks. After material measurement, our process continues with designing stacked layers of base materials. We introduce an optimization pro- cess that finds the best combination of stacked layers that meets a user's criteria specified by example deformations. Our algorithm employs a number of strategies to prune poor solutions from the combinatorial search space.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd This work presents a halftoning technique to manufacture 3D objects with the appearance of continuous grayscale imagery for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers. While droplet-based dithering is a common halftoning technique, this is not applicable to FDM printing, since FDM builds up objects by extruding material in semi-continuous paths. The line-based halftoning principle called ‘hatching' is applied to the line patterns naturally occurring in FDM prints, which are built up in a layer-by-layer fashion. The proposed halftoning technique is not limited by the challenges existing techniques face; existing FDM coloring techniques greatly influence the surface geometry and deteriorate with surface slopes deviating from vertical or greatly influence the basic parameters of the printing process and thereby the structural properties of the resulting product. Furthermore, the proposed technique has little effect on printing time. Experiments on a dual-nozzle FDM printer show promising results. Future work is required to calibrate the perceived tone.},

abstract = {Notwithstanding the widespread use and large number of advantages over traditional subtractive manufacturing techniques, the application of additive manufacturing technologies is currently limited by the undesirable fabricating efficiency, which has attracted attentions from a wide range of areas, such as fabrication method, material improvement, and algorithm optimization. As a critical step in the process planning of additive manufacturing, path planning plays a significant role in affecting the build time by means of determining the paths for the printing head's movement. So a novel path filling pattern for the deposition of extrusion–based additive manufacturing is developed in this paper, mainly to avoid the retraction during the deposition process, and hence the time moving along these retracting paths can be saved and the discontinuous deposition can be avoided as well. On the basis of analysis and discussion of the reason behind the occurrence of retraction in the deposition process, a path planning strategy called “go and back” is presented to avoid the retraction issue. The “go and back” strategy can be adopted to generate a continuous extruder path for simple areas with the start point being connected to the end point. So a sliced layer can be decomposed into several simple areas and the sub-paths for each area are generated based on the proposed strategy. All of these obtainable sub-paths can be connected into a continuous path with proper selection of the start point. By doing this, separated sub-paths are joined with each other to decrease the number of the startup and shutdown process for the extruder, which is beneficial for the enhancement of the deposition quality and the efficiency. Additionally, some methodologies are proposed to further optimize the generated non-retraction paths. At last, several cases are used to test and verify the developed methodology and the comparisons with conventional path filling patterns are conducted. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the retraction motions and is especially beneficial for the high efficient additive manufacturing without compromise on the part resistance.},

abstract = {The use of space filling curves for proximity-improving mappings is well known and has found many useful applications in parallel computing. Such curves permit a linear array to be mapped onto a 2D (respectively, 3D) structure such that points that are distance d apart in the linear array are distance O(d(1/2)) (O(d(1/3))) apart in the 2D (3D) array and vice versa. We extend the concept of space filling curves to space filling surfaces and show how these surfaces lead to mappings from 2D to 3D so that points at distance d 1 2 on the 2D surface are mapped to points at distance O(d(1/3)) in the 3D volume. Three classes of surfaces, associated respectively with the Peano curve, Sierpinski carpet, and the Hilbert curve, are presented. A methodology for using these surfaces to map from 2D to 3D is developed. These results permit efficient execution of 2D computations on processors interconnected in a 3D grid. The space filling surfaces proposed by us are the first such fractal objects to be formally defined and are thus also of intrinsic interest in the context of fractal geometry.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of generating a line drawing from a given image for fused deposition modeling. The abstracted line drawing, comprising of lines with a single color and thickness, would preserve both tone and edges of the input image. We first partition the image into sub-regions manually. The boundaries of the sub-regions are extracted as the feature lines of the image. Next, a proper number of points are randomly placed on the image plane with a density proportional to the darkness of the image. We use Lloyd's method to push the sampling points away from each other and the feature lines. The points within each sub-region are then connected by solving a travelling salesman problem (TSP). Finally, we further optimize the fairness and the spacing of the lines by minimizing a tailored objective function. A variety of experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of our method for generating line drawings for 3D printing.},

abstract = {An {\$}r{\$}-gentiling is a dissection of a shape into {\$}r \backslashgeq 2{\$} parts which are all similar to the original shape. An {\$}r{\$}-reptiling is an {\$}r{\$}-gentiling of which all parts are mutually congruent. By applying gentilings recursively, together with a rule that defines an order on the parts, one may obtain an order in which to traverse all points within the original shape. We say such a traversal is a face-continuous space-filling curve if, at any level of recursion, the interior of the union of any set of consecutive parts is connected---that is, consecutive parts must always meet along an edge. Most famously, the isosceles right triangle admits a 2-reptiling, which forms the basis of the face-continuous Sierpinski space-filling curve; many other right triangles admit reptilings and gentilings that yield face-continuous space-filling curves as well. In this study we investigate what acute triangles admit non-trivial reptilings and gentilings, and whether these can form the basis for face-continuous space-filling curves. We derive several properties of reptilings and gentilings of acute (sometimes also obtuse) triangles, leading to the following conclusion: no face-continuous space-filling curve can be constructed on the basis of reptilings of acute triangles.},

By the creative application of traditional distance field algorithm into the Boolean operations of the anatomical model and TPMS-based unit cell library, an almost defects free porous scaffolds having the complicated micro-structure and high quality external surface faithful to a specific anatomic model can be easily obtained without the difficult and time-consuming trimming and re-meshing processes. After generating the distance fields for the given tissue model and required internal micro-structure, a series of simple modifications in distance fields enable us to obtain a complex porous scaffold.

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel two-scale framework to optimize the structure and the material distribution of an object given its functional specifications. Our approach utilizes multi-material microstructures as low-level building blocks of the object. We start by precomputing the material property gamut -- the set of bulk material properties that can be achieved with all material microstructures of a given size. We represent the boundary of this material property gamut using a level set field. Next, we propose an efficient and general topology optimization algorithm that simultaneously computes an optimal object topology and spatially-varying material properties constrained by the precomputed gamut. Finally, we map the optimal spatially-varying material properties onto the microstructures with the corresponding properties in order to generate a high-resolution printable structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by designing, optimizing, and fabricating objects in different material property spaces on the level of a trillion voxels, i.e several orders of magnitude higher than what can be achieved with current systems.},

abstract = {Figure 1: Our method procedurally generates structures with graded material elasticities, which can be directly fabricated. Here the user paints elasticity on a 3D model to create a flexible figurine. Model: Moomin (thing:1173447) by Jeroentjj. Abstract Microstructures at the scale of tens of microns change the physical properties of objects, making them lighter or more flexible. While traditionally difficult to produce, additive manufacturing now lets us physically realize such microstruc-tures at low cost. In this paper we propose to study procedural, aperiodic microstructures inspired by Voronoi open-cell foams. The absence of regularity affords for a simple approach to grade the foam geometry — and thus its mechanical properties — within a target object and its surface. Rather than requiring a global optimization process, the microstructures are di-rectly generated to exhibit a specified elastic behavior. The implicit evaluation is akin to procedural textures in com-puter graphics, and locally adapts to follow the elasticity field. This allows very detailed structures to be generated in large objects without having to explicitly produce a full representation — mesh or voxels — of the complete object: the structures are added on the fly, just before each object slice is manufactured. We study the elastic behavior of the microstructures and pro-vide a complete description of the procedure generating them. We explain how to determine the geometric parameters of the microstructures from a target elasticity, and evaluate the result on printed samples. Finally, we apply our approach to the fabrication of objects with spatially varying elasticity, in-cluding the implicit modeling of a frame following the object surface and seamlessly connecting to the microstructures.},

Foundry provides an interactive and visual process for hierarchically designing spatially-varying material properties (e.g., appearance, mechanical, optical). The result- ing meta-materials exhibit structure at the micro and macro level and can surpass the qualities of traditional composites. The material definitions are created by composing a set of operators into an operator graph. Each operator performs a volume decomposition operation, remaps space, or constructs and assigns a material composition. The operators are imple- mented using a domain-specific language for multi-material fabrication; users can easily extend the library by writing their own operators. Foundry can be used to build operator graphs that describe complex, parameterized, resolution-independent, and reusable material definitions. We also describe how to stage the evaluation of the final material definition which in conjunction with progressive refinement, allows for interac- tive material evaluation even for complex designs. We show sophisticated and functional parts designed with our system.},

This STAR examines recent systems devel-oped by the computer graphics community in which designers specify higher-level goals ranging from structural integrity and deformation to appearance and aesthetics, with the final detailed shape and manufacturing instructions emerging as the result of computation. It summarizes frameworks for interaction, simulation, and optimization, as well as documents the range of general objectives and domain-specific goals that have been considered. An important unifying thread in this analysis is that different underlying geometric and physical representations are necessary for different tasks: we document over a dozen classes of representations that have been used for fabrication-aware design in the literature. We analyze how these classes possess obvious advantages for some needs, but have also been used in creative manners to facilitate unexpected problem solutions.},

abstract = {Topology optimization is finding renewed interest thanks to additive manufacturing-a technology that is well-suited to fabricate the complex organic shapes and structures that often arise from topology optimization. This paper reviews the current state of topology optimization software through the redesign of a real aerospace mounting plate, focusing on manufacturing considerations that are important for additive manufacturing (AM). Twenty different commercial and educational software tools are investigated and categorized based on their capabilities. Two representative software tools are then demonstrated with well-known examples to compare user interfaces and outputs, and one is chosen to perform the mounting plate case study. We find that all of the commercially available topology optimization software packages offer similar capabilities and considerably more functionality than educational software, but only a few niche products can be tailored to specific applications and manufacturing processes. Current commercial software does not provide adequate manufacturing constraints to remove the need for manual interpretation of results for additive manufacture. A case study involving optimization of an industry-relevant component for AM is used to provide in-depth understanding of both topology optimization and manufacturing considerations in AM. Shortcomings in the existing software tools are presented, and future requirements to take advantage of the increasing AM capabilities, particularly in metals, are discussed. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2016 by ASME.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing methods provide an increasingly popular industrial means of producing complex mechanical parts when classical methods are not suitable. The main advantage of these methods is the great freedom they give designers. At the same time, theoretical and numerical topology optimization tools can be used to simulate structures with complex shapes which exactly meet the mechanical constraints while requiring as little material as possible. Combining topology optimization and additive production procedures therefore seems to be a promising approach for obtaining optimized mechanical parts. Nonetheless structures obtained via topology optimization are composed of parts of composite densities which can not produced via additive manufacturing. Only numerical structures made of full or empty spaces only can be produced by additive methods. This can be obtained at the end of computational optimization through a penalization step which gives the composite densities from 0 to 1 the values 0 or 1. This means that the final part is different from the best solution predicted by topology optimization calculations. It therefore seemed to be worth checking the validity of an engineering approach in which additive methods are used to manufacture structures based on the use of industrial topology optimization codes. Here the authors propose to study, in the case of a simple mechanical problem, that of a metal cube subjected to a given pressure, three procedures, which differed in terms of the code and type of topology optimization calculations performed and the level of penalization applied. The three structures thus obtained were then produced using additive methods. Since all three structures proved to be mechanically resistant, the three procedures used can be said to be valid. However, one of them yielded better compromise between the mechanical strength and the amount of material saved.},

abstract = {An algorithm for generating a toolpath for a milling machine is described. The approach to its design was interdisciplinary. The algorithm contains ideas from computer graphics and mathematics, rather than mechanical engineering alone. An artefact described by any set of curved surfaces is carved out of a workpiece in two stages. Horizontal slices are removed to reveal the roughly cut artefact, and a final pass cuts the artefact to within a preset tolerance. The toolpath might seem to be needlessly convoluted, but it has substantial advantages over less sophisticated paths. Its local complexity adapts automatically to the local complexity of the artefact, so that more attention is concentrated on those parts of the artefact which require it. At the roughing out stage, the path efficiently skips over completely worked areas without retracing them with each new horizontal slice. The path minimizes the amount of tool movement which does not cut material, and minimizes the number of occassions on which the tool reenters the material. A prototype system has been developed to demonstrate that the new approach is viable. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {3D printing hardware is rapidly scaling up to output continuous mixtures of multiple materials at increasing resolution over ever larger print volumes. This poses an enormous computational chal- lenge: large high-resolution prints comprise trillions of voxels and petabytes of data and simply modeling and describing the input with spatially varying material mixtures at this scale is challeng- ing. Existing 3D printing software is insufficient; in particular, most software is designed to support only a few million primitives, with discrete material choices per object. We present OpenFab, a programmable pipeline for synthesis of multi-material 3D printed objects that is inspired by RenderMan and modern GPU pipelines. The pipeline supports procedural evaluation of geometric detail and material composition, using shader-like fablets, allowing models to be specified easily and efficiently. We describe a streaming archi- tecture for OpenFab; only a small fraction of the final volume is stored in memory and output is fed to the printer with little startup delay. We demonstrate it on a variety of multi-material objects. CR},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.This paper is focused on finding the efficient path generating algorithms. These algorithms can take part in the path planning process, which is the last stage in model processing for 3D printing. The paper provides the comparative analysis of the five implemented path generating algorithms, which are based on four strategies: ZigZag strategy, Contour strategy, Spiral Strategy, and Fractal strategy. The analysis is based on the results of experiments made with the designed and implemented experimentation system. The system allows carrying out two types of experiments: simulation experiments and physical one. The simulation experiment is performed with the programming application written in C{\#}. The physical experiments utilized FDM technology for 3D printing. Basing on the obtained results, we can conclude that the algorithm based on the ZigZag strategy seems to be better than the algorithms based on other approaches.},

abstract = {Hierarchical structures, also known as fractal structures, exhibit advantageous material properties, such as water- and oil-repellency as well as other useful optical characteristics, owing to its self similarity. Various methods have been developed for producing hierarchical geometrical structures. Recently, fractal structures have been manufactured using a 3D printing technique that involves computer aided design data. In this study, we confirmed the accuracy of geometrical structures when Koch curve-like fractal structures with zero to three generations were printed using a 3D printer. The fractal dimension was analyzed using a box-counting method. This analysis indicated that the fractal dimension of the third generation hierarchical structure was approximately the same as that of the ideal Koch curve. These findings demonstrate that the design and production of fractal structures can be controlled using a 3D printer. Although the interior angle deviated from the ideal value, the side length could be precisely controlled. {\textcopyright} 2017 by Japan Oil Chemists' Society.},

abstract = {Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is one of the most widespread additive manufacturing technique used for fabricating 3D objects without any design constraints. It is a solid-based process in which polymers material in the form of semi molten state is extruded from the nozzle to fabricate the 3D objects. In the present work, a new tool path strategy for FDM process has been developed based on Hilbert curve. Hilbert curve is a space filling fractal curve and its hausdorff dimension is two. This curve is surjective and continuous in nature. The proposed tool path from developed program are validated though simulation and experimental results. The new approach has been simulated using MATLAB computing platform. Boolean operators like intersection and subtraction are utilized for finding the intersection points for the tool path generation. A self-developed extruder system based on screw extrusion is used for the real time application of the algorithm developed. The extruder head is reconfigured to an existing CNC milling machine for printing and production purpose. Case study for different types of prototypes are also presented to demonstrate the capabilities of developed tool path algorithm.},

abstract = {Purpose In Additive manufacturing process, the physical properties of the products made by fractal toolpaths are better as compared to those made by conventional toolpaths. Also it is desirable to minimise the number of tool retractions. This work describes three different methods to generate fractal-based CNC toolpath for area filling of a closed curve with minimum or zero tool retractions. Design/methodology/approach This work describes three different methods to generate fractal-based CNC toolpath for area filling of a closed curve with minimum or zero tool retractions. In first method a large fractal square is placed over the outer boundary and then rest of the unwanted curve is trimmed out. To reduce the number of retractions, ends of the trimmed toolpath are connected in such a way that overlapping within the existing toolpath is avoided. In second method the trimming of the fractal is similar to the first method but the ends of trimmed toolpath are connected such that the overlapping is found at the boundaries only. The toolpath in third method is a combination of fractal and zigzag curves. This toolpath is capable of filling a given connected area in a single pass without any tool retraction and toolpath overlap within a tolerance value equal to stepover of the toolpath. Findings The generated toolpath has several applications in Additive Manufacturing and constant Z-height surface finishing. Experiments have been performed to verify the toolpath by depositing material by Hybrid Layered Manufacturing process. Research limitations/implications Third toolpath method is suitable for the Hybrid Layered Manufacturing process only because the toolpath overlapping tolerance may not be enough for other Additive Manufacturing processes. Originality/value Development of a CNC toolpath for Additive Manufacturing Specifically Hybrid Layered Manufacturing which can completely fill any arbitrary connected area in single pass while maintaining a constant stepover.},

Recently domain decomposition and space filling curves have been introduced for slice generation in FDM [1]. The current work focuses on the implementations of fractal-like buildstyle patterns using Simulated Annealing [2, 3], Lin-Kernighan algorithms [4] and Construction Procedures based on Nearest Neighbor Heuristics [5]. These computational optimization procedures are able to generate filling patterns that allow the continuous deposition of a single road to fill arbitrary shaped domains. The necessary software modules to produce arbitrary three-dimensional artifacts have been developed and are evaluated with respect to part quality and build time.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the issues and opportunities for the application of topology optimization methods for additive manufacturing (AM). The main analysis issues discussed are: how to achieve the maximum geometric resolution to allow the fine features easily manufacturable by AM to be represented in the optimization model; the manufacturing constraints to be considered, and the workflow modifications required to handle the geometric complexity in the post optimization stages. The main manufacturing issues discussed are the potential for realizing intermediate density regions, in the case of the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach, the use of small scale lattice structures, the use of multiple material AM processes, and an approach to including support structure requirement as a manufacturing constraint.

abstract = {Rapid prototyping (RP) and more generally Additive Manufacturing (AM) enable the manufacture of complex geometries, which are very difficult to build with classical production. There are numerous technologies that are using different kind of material. For each of these, there are at least two materials: the production material and the support one. Support material is, in most cases, cleaned and becomes a manufacturing residue. Improve the material volume and the global mass of the product is an essential aim surrounding the integration of simulation in additive manufacturing process. Moreover the layer-by-layer technology of additive manufacturing allows the design of innovative objects and the use of topological optimization in this context can create a very interesting combination. The purpose of our paper is to present a methodology and a tool, which allow the use of topological optimization for the preparation of model for RP and AM.},

the simulation domain have recently shown their effectiveness in
physically based simulation of deformable bodies with changing topology.
In this paper we present an efficient collision detection method for CFE
simulation of cuts. Our method exploits the specific characteristics of
CFEs, i.e., the fact that the number of simulation degrees of freedom is
significantly reduced. We show that this feature not only leads to a
faster deformation simulation, but also enables a faster collision
detection. To address the non-conforming properties of geometric
composition and hexahedral discretization, we propose a topology-aware
interpolation approach for the computation of penetration depth. We show
that this approach leads to accurate collision detection on complex
boundaries. Our results demonstrate that by using our method cutting on
high-resolution deformable bodies including collision detection and
response can be performed at interactive rates.},

presents a coherent summary of the state of the art in virtual cutting

topological representations of the deformable body, as well as the
specific numerical discretizations of the governing equations of motion.
In particular, we discuss virtual cutting based on tetrahedral,
hexahedral and polyhedral meshes, in combination with standard,
polyhedral, composite and extended finite element discretizations. A
separate section is devoted to meshfree methods. Furthermore, we discuss
cutting-related research problems such as collision detection and haptic

complemented with an application study to assess the performance of
virtual cutting simulators.},

abstract = {Rigid body contact with multiple regions is common in virtual
environments. The traditional penalty based haptic display treats
translational penetration depth at each contact region independently,
and hence causes the undesired effect of visual interpenetration since
it does not guarantee all geometrical constraints simultaneously. It may
also introduce force discontinuity due to the singularity of penetration
depth. To overcome these artifacts, we present a method based on the
concept of generalized penetration depth (GPD), which considers both
translation and rotation to separate two overlapping objects. The method
could be viewed as an extension of the classic god-object method from
Euclidean space to configuration space in which GPD is defined. We
demonstrate the method for 3-DoF rigid bodies using pre-computed contact
space. For 6-DoF rigid bodies where pre-computation is not feasible, we
propose an efficient method to approximate the local contact space based
on continuous collision detection and quadratic programming.},

abstract = {A key requirement in 3D fabrication is to generate objects with individual exterior shapes and their interior being optimized to application-specific force constraints and low material consumption. Accomplishing this task is challenging on desktop computers, due to the extreme model resolutions that are required to accurately predict the physical shape properties, requiring memory and computational capacities going beyond what is currently available. Moreover, fabrication-specific constraints need to be considered to enable printability. To address these challenges, we present a scalable system for generating 3D objects using topology optimization, which allows to efficiently evolve the topology of high-resolution solids towards printable and light-weight-high-resistance structures. To achieve this, the system is equipped with a high-performance GPU solver which can efficiently handle models comprising several millions of elements. A minimum thickness constraint is built into the optimization process to automatically enforce printability of the resulting shapes. We further shed light on the question how to incorporate geometric shape constraints, such as symmetry and pattern repetition, in the optimization process. We analyze the performance of the system and demonstrate its potential by a variety of different shapes such as interior structures within closed surfaces, exposed support structures, and surface models.},

abstract = {The facial performance of an individual is inherently rich in subtle deformation and timing details. Although these subtleties make the performance realistic and compelling, they often elude both motion capture and hand animation. We present a technique for adding fine-scale details and expressive- ness to low-resolution art-directed facial performances, such as those created manually using a rig, via marker-based capture, by fitting a morphable model to a video, or through Kinect reconstruction using recent faceshift technology. We employ a high-resolution facial performance capture system to acquire a representative performance of an individual in which he or she explores the full range of facial expressiveness. From the captured data, our system extracts an expressiveness model that encodes subtle spatial and temporal deformation details specific to that particular individual. Once this model has been built, these details can be transferred to low-resolution art-directed performances. We demonstrate results on various forms of input; after our enhancement, the resulting animations exhibit the same nuances and fine spatial details as the captured performance, with optional temporal enhancement to match the dynamics of the actor. Finally, we show that our technique outperforms the current state-of-the-art in example-based facial animation.},
