abstract="Topology optimization is a technique that allows for increasingly efficient designs with minimal a priori decisions. Because of the complexity and intricacy of the solutions obtained, topology optimization was often constrained to research and theoretical studies. Additive manufacturing, a rapidly evolving field, fills the gap between topology optimization and application. Additive manufacturing has minimal limitations on the shape and complexity of the design, and is currently evolving towards new materials, higher precision and larger build sizes. Two topology optimization methods are addressed: the ground structure method and density-based topology optimization. The results obtained from these topology optimization methods require some degree of post-processing before they can be manufactured. A simple procedure is described by which output suitable for additive manufacturing can be generated. In this process, some inherent issues of the optimization technique may be magnified resulting in an unfeasible or bad product. In addition, this work aims to address some of these issues and propose methodologies by which they may be alleviated. The proposed framework has applications in a number of fields, with specific examples given from the fields of health, architecture and engineering. In addition, the generated output allows for simple communication, editing, and combination of the results into more complex designs. For the specific case of three-dimensional density-based topology optimization, a tool suitable for result inspection and generation of additive manufacturing output is also provided.",

abstract="Lightweight structures with slender features and thin walls can be fabricated by the additive manufacturing process. The fabrication process utilizes a contour parallel toolpath, where sets of parallel contours are offset from the boundaries of a geometric structure at predefined intervals to deposit the material layer by layer. Currently, these intervals are set to be constant, which limits its capability to produce near net-shape parts. In recent research, the feasibility to fabricate parts using contour parallel toolpaths with variable bead widths has been explored to increase the production speed, to improve the geometry accuracy, and to manufacture void-free parts. However, existing process planning methods are computationally inefficient and challenging to implement. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive process planning framework for adaptive contour parallel toolpath with variable bead widths. More specifically, this framework includes a toolpath planning algorithm using the level-set method and a process planning algorithm for generating the desired bead geometry using a Gaussian process regression model. To validate the proposed framework, a case study has been demonstrated in the fabrication of benchmark features with a wire and arc additive manufacturing process.",

abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to develop a set of process parameters tailored for lattice structures and test them against standard process (SP) parameters. Selective laser melting (SLM) is a commonly known and established additive manufacturing technique and is a key technology in generating intricately shaped lattice structures. However, SP parameters used in this technology have building time and accuracy disadvantages for structures with a low area-to-perimeter ratio, such as thin struts. Design/methodology/approach - In this research work, body-centred cubic structure specimens are manufactured using adapted process parameters. Central to the adapted process parameters is the positioning of the laser beam, the scan strategy and the linear energy density. The specimens are analysed with X-ray micro-computed tomography for dimensional accuracy. The final assessment is a comparison between specimens manufactured using adapted process parameters and those using SP parameters. Findings - Standard parameters for lattice structures lead to a significant shift from the nominal geometry. An extensive manufacturing and computation time due to several exposure patterns (e.g. pre-contours, post-contours) was observed. The tailored process parameters developed had good dimensional accuracy, reproducible results and improved manufacturing performance. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on a distinctive geometry of the lattice structure and a specific material. Future research should be extended to other geometries and materials. Practical implications - Optimisation of process parameters for the part geometry is a critical factor in improving dimensional accuracy and performance of SLM processes. Originality/value - This study demonstrates how application-tailored process parameters can lead to superior performance and improved dimensional accuracy. The results can be transferred to other lattice structure designs and materials.},

Two finite deformation elastic/hyperelastic-viscoplastic constitutive models calibrated based on the mechanical response of the base material are used in the computational study of the TPMS-CMs. It is shown that the specimen size of the TPMS-CMs affect their mechanical properties. Moreover, the finite element results agree with the results obtained experimentally.

abstract = {The use of space filling curves for proximity-improving mappings is well known and has found many useful applications in parallel computing. Such curves permit a linear array to be mapped onto a 2D (respectively, 3D) structure such that points that are distance d apart in the linear array are distance O(d(1/2)) (O(d(1/3))) apart in the 2D (3D) array and vice versa. We extend the concept of space filling curves to space filling surfaces and show how these surfaces lead to mappings from 2D to 3D so that points at distance d 1 2 on the 2D surface are mapped to points at distance O(d(1/3)) in the 3D volume. Three classes of surfaces, associated respectively with the Peano curve, Sierpinski carpet, and the Hilbert curve, are presented. A methodology for using these surfaces to map from 2D to 3D is developed. These results permit efficient execution of 2D computations on processors interconnected in a 3D grid. The space filling surfaces proposed by us are the first such fractal objects to be formally defined and are thus also of intrinsic interest in the context of fractal geometry.},

abstract = {Rapid Prototyping (RP) technologies provide the ability to fabricate initial prototypes from various model materials. Stratasys Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a typical RP process that can fabricate prototypes out of ABS plastic. To predict the mechanical behavior of FDM parts, it is critical to understand the material properties of the raw FDM process material, and the effect that FDM build parameters have on anisotropic material properties. This paper characterizes the properties of ABS parts fabricated by the FDM 1650. Using a Design of Experiment (DOE) approach, the process parameters of FDM, such as raster orientation, air gap, bead width, color, and model temperature were examined. Tensile strengths and compressive strengths of directionally fabricated specimens were measured and compared with injection molded FDM ABS P400 material. For the FDM parts made with a 0.003 inch overlap between roads, the typical tensile strength ranged between 65 and 72 percent of the strength of injection molded ABS P400. The compressive strength ranged from 80 to 90 percent of the injection molded FDM ABS. Several build rules for designing FDM parts were formulated based on experimental results.},

@article{ajdari2012hierarchical,
abstract = {We investigated the mechanical behavior of two-dimensional hierarchical honeycomb structures using analytical, numerical and experimental methods. Hierarchical honeycombs were constructed by replacing every three-edge vertex of a regular hexagonal lattice with a smaller hexagon. Repeating this process builds a fractal-appearing structure. The resulting isotropic in-plane elastic properties (effective elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio) of this structure are controlled by the dimension ratios for different hierarchical orders. Hierarchical honeycombs of first and second order can be up to 2.0 and 3.5 times stiffer than regular honeycomb at the same mass (i.e., same overall average density). The Poisson's ratio varies from nearly 1.0 (when planar 'bulk' modulus is considerably greater than Young's modulus, so the structure acts 'incompressible' for most loadings) to 0.28, depending on the dimension ratios. The work provides insight into the role of structural organization and hierarchy in regulating the mechanical behavior of materials, and new opportunities for developing low-weight cellular structures with tailorable properties. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The in-plane dynamic crushing of two dimensional honeycombs with both regular hexagonal and irregular arrangements was investigated using detailed finite element models. The energy absorption of honeycombs made of a linear elastic-perfectly plastic material with constant and functionally graded density were estimated up to large crushing strains. Our numerical simulations showed three distinct crushing modes for honeycombs with a constant relative density: quasi-static, transition and dynamic. Moreover, irregular cellular structures showed to have energy absorption similar to their counterpart regular honeycombs of same relative density and mass. To study the dynamic crushing of functionally graded cellular structures, a density gradient in the direction of crushing was introduced in the computational models by a gradual change of the cell wall thickness. Decreasing the relative density in the direction of crushing was shown to enhance the energy absorption of honeycombs at early stages of crushing. The study provides new insight into the behavior of engineered and biological cellular materials, and could be used to develop novel energy absorbent structures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent advances in additive manufacturing facilitated the fabrication of parts with great geometrical complexity and relatively small size, and allowed for the fabrication of topologies that could not have been achieved using traditional fabrication techniques. In this work, we explore the topology-property relationship of several classes of periodic cellular materials; the first class is strut-based structures, while the second and third classes are derived from the mathematically created triply periodic minimal surfaces, namely; the skeletal-TPMS and sheet-TPMS cellular structures. Powder bed fusion technology was employed to fabricate the cellular structures of various relative densities out of Maraging steel. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also employed to assess the quality of the printed parts. Compressive testing was performed to deduce the mechanical properties of the considered cellular structures. Results showed that the sheet-TPMS based cellular structures exhibited a near stretching-dominated deformation behavior, while skeletal-TPMS showed a bending-dominated behavior. On the other hand, the Kelvin and Gibson-Ashby strut-based topologies exhibited a mixed mode of deformation while the Octet-truss showed a stretching-dominated behavior. Overall the sheet-TPMS based cellular structures showed superior mechanical properties among all the tested structures. The most interesting observation is that sheet-based Diamond TPMS structure showed the best mechanical performance with nearly independence of relative density. It was also observed that at decreased volume fractions the effect of geometry on the mechanical properties is more pronounced.},

abstract = {The medial axis transform (or MAT) is a representation of an object as an infinite union of balls. We consider approximating the MAT of a three-dimensional object, and its complement, with a finite union of balls. Using this approximate MAT we define a new piecewise-linear approximation to the object surface, which we call the power crust. We assume that we are given as input a sufficiently dense sample of points from the object surface. We select a subset of the Voronoi balls of the sample, the polar balls, as the union of balls representation. We bound the geometric error of the union, and of the corresponding power crust, and show that both representations are topologically correct as well. Thus, our results provide a new algorithm for surface reconstruction from sample points. By construction, the power crust is always the boundary of a polyhedral solid, so we avoid the polygonization, hole-filling or manifold extraction steps used in previous algorithms. The union of balls representation and the power crust have corresponding piecewise-linear dual representations, which in some sense approximate the medial axis. We show a geometric relationship between these duals and the medial axis by proving that, as the sampling density goes to infinity, the set of poles, the centers of the polar balls, converges to the medial axis. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) enables the production of geometrically complex parts that are difficult to manufacture by other means. However, conventional CAD systems are limited in the representation of such parts. This issue is exacerbated when lattice structures are combined or embedded within a complex geometry. This paper presents a computationally efficient, voxel-based method of generating lattices comprised of practically any cell type that can conform to an arbitrary external geometry. The method of conforming involves the tessellation and trimming of unit cells that can leave ‘hanging' struts at the surface, which is a possible point of weakness in the structure. A method of joining these struts to form an external two dimensional lattice, termed a ‘net-skin' is also described. Traditional methods of manufacturing lattice structures generally do not allow variation of cell properties within a structure; however, additive manufacturing enables graded lattices to be generated that are potentially more optimal. A method of functionally grading lattices is, therefore, also described to take advantage of this manufacturing capability.},

Findings Occurrence conditions for all causes were determined and visualized in a process map, which was also developed into a software procedure for the diagnosis of quality issues on digital models of the parts.

To the non-scientist, their image is that of soft, compliant, things: cushions, packaging and padding. To the food scientist they are familiar as bread, cake and desserts of the best kind: meringue, mousse and sponge. To those who study nature they are the structural materials of their subject: wood, coral, cancellous bone. And to the engineer they are of vast importance in building lightweight structures, for energy management, for thermal insulation, filtration and much more. When a solid is converted into a material with a foam-like structure, the single-valued properties of the solid are extended. By properties we mean stiffness, strength, thermal conductivity and diffusivity, electrical resistivity and so forth. And the extension is vast-the properties can be changed by a factor of 1000 or more. Perhaps the most important concept in analysing the mechanical behaviour is that of the distinction between a stretch- and a bending-dominated structure. The first is exceptionally stiff and strong for a given mass; the second is compliant and, although not strong, it absorbs energy well when compressed. This paper summarizes a little of the way in which the mechanical properties of cellular solids are analysed and illustrates the range of properties offered by alternative configurations.},

The so called "computational fabrication" pipeline comprises all the steps necessary to turn a design idea into a physical object, and this book describes the most recent advancements in the two fundamental phases along this pipeline: design and process planning. We examine recent systems in the computer graphics community that allow us to take a design idea from conception to a digital model, and classify algorithms that are necessary to turn such a digital model into an appropriate sequence of machining instructions.

@article{avalle2001characterization,
abstract = {The mechanical properties at room temperature of three polymeric foams (namely EPP, PUR and PS/PA foams) have been experimentally evaluated in both static and impact loading conditions. The energy absorption characteristics have been examined both through the energy-absorption diagram method and through the efficiency diagram method. The meaning of the efficiency parameter, already used in the literature, has been explained in a proper, satisfactory way. It is shown that the maximum of the efficiency identifies the condition for optimal energy absorption of the foam, while the maximum stress reaches a value limited through other design considerations. The efficiency diagram method is then used to obtain synthetic diagrams useful to characterize the material and to help the design of energy absorbing components. These synthetic selection diagrams are obtained for the three tested materials. Finally, some consideration are drawn comparing the mechanical performance of the three considered types of foams and their dependency on density. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Fused filament fabrication of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) offers a capability to manufacture tailorable, flexible honeycomb structures which can be optimised for energy absorbing applications. This work explores the effect of a range of grading methodologies on the energy absorbing and damping behaviour of flexible TPU honeycomb structures. By applying density grading, the energy absorbing and damping profiles are significantly modified from the uniform density equivalent. A 3D-printing procedure was developed which allowed the manufacture of high-quality structures, which underwent cyclic loading to densification without failure. Graded honeycomb architectures had an average relative density of 0.375 ± 0.05. After quasi-static testing, arrays were subjected to sinusoidal compression over a range of amplitudes at 0.5 Hz. By grading the structural density in different ways, mechanical damping was modified. Cyclic compressive testing also showed how strain-softening of the TPU parent material could lead to reduced damping over the course of 50 cycles. Samples were subjected to impact loading at strain-rates of up to 51 s-1 and specific impact energies of up to 270 mJ/cm3. Lower peak loads were transferred for graded samples for the most severe impact cases. This behaviour reveals the potential of density grading of TPU structures to provide superior impact protection in extreme environmental conditions.},

@article{Behandish2019a,
abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) enables enormous freedom for design of complex structures. However, the process-dependent limitations that result in discrepancies between as-designed and as-manufactured shapes are not fully understood. The tradeoffs between infinitely many different ways to approximate a design by a manufacturable replica are even harder to characterize. To support design for AM (DfAM), one has to quantify local discrepancies introduced by AM processes, identify the detrimental deviations (if any) to the original design intent, and prescribe modifications to the design and/or process parameters to countervail their effects. Our focus in this work will be on topological analysis. There is ample evidence in many applications that preserving local topology (e.g., connectivity of beams in a lattice) is important even when slight geometric deviations can be tolerated. We first present a generic method to characterize local topological discrepancies due to material under- and over-deposition in AM, and show how it captures various types of defects in the as-manufactured structures. We use this information to systematically modify the as-manufactured outcomes within the limitations of available 3D printer resolution(s), which often comes at the expense of introducing more geometric deviations (e.g., thickening a beam to avoid disconnection). We validate the effectiveness of the method on 3D examples with nontrivial topologies such as lattice structures and foams.},

This STAR examines recent systems devel-oped by the computer graphics community in which designers specify higher-level goals ranging from structural integrity and deformation to appearance and aesthetics, with the final detailed shape and manufacturing instructions emerging as the result of computation. It summarizes frameworks for interaction, simulation, and optimization, as well as documents the range of general objectives and domain-specific goals that have been considered. An important unifying thread in this analysis is that different underlying geometric and physical representations are necessary for different tasks: we document over a dozen classes of representations that have been used for fabrication-aware design in the literature. We analyze how these classes possess obvious advantages for some needs, but have also been used in creative manners to facilitate unexpected problem solutions.},

Our process starts with measuring deformation properties of base materials. For each base material we acquire a set of example deformations, and we represent the material as a non-linear stress-strain relationship in a finite-element model. We have validated our material measure- ment process by comparing simulations of arbitrary stacks of base materials with measured deformations of fabricated material stacks. After material measurement, our process continues with designing stacked layers of base materials. We introduce an optimization pro- cess that finds the best combination of stacked layers that meets a user's criteria specified by example deformations. Our algorithm employs a number of strategies to prune poor solutions from the combinatorial search space.

abstract = {Fused Deposition Modeling is one of the earliest types of Additive Manufacturing technologies. In this process a physical object is fabricated directly from a Computer-Aided Design model using layer-by-layer extrusion of a feedstock plastic filament material through a nozzle. It was originally developed for design and functional prototype applications but, in the last decade, gained considerable recognition and adoption in industry due to the process simplicity, affordability, and ability to make parts in a range of common engineering thermoplastics. Thus Fused Deposition Modeling products must comply with tolerance and roughness requirements in order to satisfy a mechanical coupling or functionality. This work strives to develop an integrated methodology able to help the process design with the aim to goal the requirements. This method allows knowing in advance the surface quality of the Fused Deposition Modeling product at chosen process parameters. This way an ex ante product check is possible. Moreover the methodology can find the set of solutions when the requirements are prescribed on the product features: it is possible to define the technology capability and analyze the proposed fabrication conditions. This methodology is highly useful in process management also in conjunction with other operations and can help the computer aided process planning since it can predict admissible scenarios.},

abstract = {The facial performance of an individual is inherently rich in subtle deformation and timing details. Although these subtleties make the performance realistic and compelling, they often elude both motion capture and hand animation. We present a technique for adding fine-scale details and expressive- ness to low-resolution art-directed facial performances, such as those created manually using a rig, via marker-based capture, by fitting a morphable model to a video, or through Kinect reconstruction using recent faceshift technology. We employ a high-resolution facial performance capture system to acquire a representative performance of an individual in which he or she explores the full range of facial expressiveness. From the captured data, our system extracts an expressiveness model that encodes subtle spatial and temporal deformation details specific to that particular individual. Once this model has been built, these details can be transferred to low-resolution art-directed performances. We demonstrate results on various forms of input; after our enhancement, the resulting animations exhibit the same nuances and fine spatial details as the captured performance, with optional temporal enhancement to match the dynamics of the actor. Finally, we show that our technique outperforms the current state-of-the-art in example-based facial animation.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new method for triangulating a simple n-sided polygon. The algorithm runs in time O(n log s), with s {\_}{\textless} n. The quantity s measures the sinuosity of the polygon, that is, the number of times the boundary alternates between complete spirals of opposite orientation. The value of s is in practice a very small constant, even for extremely winding polygons. Our algorithm is the first method whose performance is linear in the number of vertices, up to within a factor that depends only on the shape-complexity of the polygon. Informally, this notion of shape-complexity measures how entangled a polygon is, and is thus highly independent of the number of vertices. A practical advantage of the algorithm is that it does not require sorting or the use of any balanced tree structure. Aside from the notion of sinuosity, we are also able to characterize a large class of polygons for which the algorithm can be proven to run in O(n log log n) time. The algorithm has been implemented, tested, and empirical evidence has confirmed its theoretical claim to efficiency.},

Finally, parametric analyses reveal influences of some key parameters on the local buckling stress and strength-to-density ratio; meanwhile the constitutive behaviors and energy-absorption properties, with increasing hierarchy n, are calculated. The results show the possibility to tailor the elastic buckling properties at each hierarchical level, and could thus have interesting applications, e.g., in the design of multiscale energy-absorption honeycomb light materials. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of generating a line drawing from a given image for fused deposition modeling. The abstracted line drawing, comprising of lines with a single color and thickness, would preserve both tone and edges of the input image. We first partition the image into sub-regions manually. The boundaries of the sub-regions are extracted as the feature lines of the image. Next, a proper number of points are randomly placed on the image plane with a density proportional to the darkness of the image. We use Lloyd's method to push the sampling points away from each other and the feature lines. The points within each sub-region are then connected by solving a travelling salesman problem (TSP). Finally, we further optimize the fairness and the spacing of the lines by minimizing a tailored objective function. A variety of experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of our method for generating line drawings for 3D printing.},

abstract = {Advances in additive manufacturing (AM) have drawn considerable interest due to its ability to produce geometrically complex structure, such as lattice materials. In this work, a novel methodology is proposed to design graded lattice structure through topology optimization under stress constraint, in order to generate lightweight lattice structure design with predictable yield performance. Instead of using the power law of material interpolation in the SIMP method, asymptotic homogenization method is employed to compute the effective elastic properties of lattice material in terms of design variable, i.e. relative density. For yield strength, a multiscale failure model is proposed to capture yield strength of microstructure with macroscopic stress. At macroscale, a modified Hill's yield criterion is employed to describe anisotropic yield strength of lattice material. The material constants in Hill's model are assumed to be a function of relative density, and thus a model is built up to formulate yield strength of lattice structure with macroscopic stress. The experimental verification on the printed samples demonstrates that both the homogenized elastic model and yield model can accurately describe the elasticity and plasticity of the lattice structure. Based on the proposed material interpolation for lattice structure, a lattice structure topology optimization framework is proposed for minimizing total weight of the structure under stress constraint. The sensitivity analysis is performed for the implementation of the optimization algorithm. Two three-dimensionally numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method, as well as accuracy of the proposed homogenization technique for graded lattice structure design. Experiment is conducted to systematically examine yielding of the optimally graded lattice structure design and compare its performance with a uniform structure. It is found that the proposed optimization framework is valid for the design examples examined and can significantly enhance mechanical performance of the structure (i.e. yield loading, stiffness, energy absorption, etc.)},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited. Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to propose a homogenization-based topology optimization method to optimize the design of variable-density cellular structure, in order to achieve lightweight design and overcome some of the manufacturability issues in additive manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach - First, homogenization is performed to capture the effective mechanical properties of cellular structures through the scaling law as a function their relative density. Second, the scaling law is used directly in the topology optimization algorithm to compute the optimal density distribution for the part being optimized. Third, a new technique is presented to reconstruct the computer-aided design (CAD) model of the optimal variable-density cellular structure. The proposed method is validated by comparing the results obtained through homogenized model, full-scale simulation and experimentally testing the optimized parts after being additive manufactured. Findings - The test examples demonstrate that the homogenization-based method is efficient, accurate and is able to produce manufacturable designs. Originality/value - The optimized designs in our examples also show significant increase in stiffness and strength when compared to the original designs with identical overall weight.},

The underlying philosophy of our approach is the localization idea based on the Domain Decomposition Lemma, which enables us to break up the complicated domain into smaller and simpler pieces. We then develop tree data structure and various operations on it to keep track of the information produced by the domain decomposition procedure. This strategy enables us to isolate various important points such as branch points and terminal points. Because our data structure guarantees the existence of such important points - in fact, our data structure is devised with this in mind - we can zoom in on those points. This makes our algorithm efficient. Our algorithm is a "from within" approach, whereas traditional methods use a "from-the-boundary" approach. This "from within" nature of our algorithm and the localization scheme help mitigate various instability phenomena, thereby making our algorithm reasonably robust. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

This study aims to explore the mechanical properties of functionally graded lattice structures fabricated by an additive manufacturing technique namely, selective laser melting (SLM), with Ti-6Al-4V as the building material. Both cubic lattice and honeycomb lattice structures with varied strut diameter and density were designed and manufactured, and their physical characteristics, deformation behavior and compressive properties were investigated. The collapse of structure always started from least dense layer to the denser layers. In contrast, samples with uniform density showed abrupt shear failure with diagonal cracking across the whole structure. The plateau stress and specific energy absorption of density graded samples were higher than for uniform density samples for three out of four designs by up to 67{\%} and 72{\%}, respectively. In addition, density graded lattices showed distinct energy absorption behavior with cumulative energy absorption increasing as a power of strain function while uniform density lattices showed a near-linear relationship.},

abstract = {Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a layer wise production technique enabling the production of complex metallic parts. In the SLM process parts are built by selectively melting subsequent layers of powder by a laser beam. Nowadays during SLM fixed scan parameters are used (laser power, scan velocity and scan pattern) that should ensure the formation of a sufficiently large and stable melt pool fusing powder particles together. The stability of the melt pool formed during SLM should ensure adequate part accuracy, surface roughness and part density, and thus good mechanical properties. However, the local geometry of the part being build has a large influence on the thermal behavior in and around the melt pool and therefore on the quality of features, mainly when melting along thin walls, sharp corners or down facing layers (layers above powder) that largely influences the local thermal behavior. Detecting such features from the CAD model and using locally adapted scanning parameters for processing those features enables to optimize the quality and density of the part, independently of its local geometry. This paper studies strategies to build thin walls with correct dimensions using locally optimized scan parameters.},

abstract = {Abstract The medial axis of a surface in 3D is the closure of all points that have two or more closest points on the surface. It is an essential geometric structure in a number of applications involving 3D geometric shapes. Since exact computation of the medial axis is difficult in general, efforts continue to improve their approximations. Voronoi diagrams turn out to be useful for this approximation. Although it is known that Voronoi vertices for a sample of points from a curve in 2D approximate its medial axis, a similar result does not hold in 3D. Recently, it has been discovered that only a subset of Voronoi vertices converge to the medial axis as sample density approaches infinity. However, most applications need a nondiscrete approximation as opposed to a discrete one. To date no known algorithm can compute this approximation straight from the Voronoi diagram with a guarantee of convergence. We present such an algorithm and its convergence analysis in this paper. One salient feature of the algorithm is that it is scale and density independent. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical claims.},

abstract = {Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a promising alternative to traditional subtractive manufacturing for fabricating large aerospace components that feature high buy-to-fly ratio. Since the WAAM process builds up a part with complex geometry through the deposition of weld beads on a layer-by-layer basis, it is important to model the geometry of a single weld bead as well as the multi-bead overlapping process in order to achieve high surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the fabricated parts. This study firstly builds models for a single weld bead through various curve fitting methods. The experimental results show that both parabola and cosine functions accurately represent the bead profile. The overlapping principle is then detailed to model the geometry of multiple beads overlapping together. The tangent overlapping model (TOM) is established and the concept of the critical centre distance for stable multi-bead overlapping processes is presented. The proposed TOM is shown to provide a much better approximation to the experimental measurements when compared with the traditional flat-top overlapping model (FOM). This is critical in process planning to achieve better geometry accuracy and material efficiency in additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology to generate deposition paths for wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The medial axis transformation (MAT), which represents the skeleton of a given geometry, is firstly extracted to understand the geometry. Then a deposition path that is based on the MAT is efficiently generated. The resulting MAT-based path is able to entirely fill any given cross-sectional geometry without gaps. With the variation of step-over distance, material efficiency alters accordingly for both solid and thin-walled structures. It is found that thin-walled structures are more sensitive to step-over distance in terms of material efficiency. The optimal step-over distance corresponding to the maximum material efficiency can be achieved for various geometries, allowing the optimization of the deposition parameters. Five case studies of complex models including solid and thin-walled structures are used to test the developed methodology. Experimental comparison between the proposed MAT-based path patterns and the traditional contour path patterns demonstrate significant improved performance in terms of gap-free cross-sections. The proposed path planning strategy is shown to be particularly beneficial for WAAM of thin-walled structures.},

This paper presents an innovative path planning strategy using medial axis transformation for the wire-feed additive manufacturing process. The proposed path planning strategy is able to improve geometrical accuracy and produce void-free deposition by continuously altering the deposition width of the wire-feed process to accommodate the component geometry, while simultaneously minimising the number of interruptions to the deposition process at the component boundary. As a result, both buy-to-fly ratio and energy consumption are improved through reducing material waste. The algorithm for generating the adaptive path is described and validated through application to various typical geometries. Buy-to-fly ratios are calculated for a number of thin-walled complex structures. Savings of more than 27{\%} in material usage are achieved using adaptive path planning, when compared with non-adaptive methods. The proposed method is tested experimentally through deposition of two metal components. The results demonstrate that the adaptive strategy is capable of generating void-free deposition with improved accuracy at the component boundary using the wire-feed additive manufacturing process.},

abstract = {Several techniques exist to automatically synthesize a 2D image resembling an input exemplar texture. Most of the approaches op- timize a new image so that the color neighborhoods in the output closely match those in the input, across all scales. In this paper we revisit by-example texture synthesis in the context of additive man- ufacturing. Our goal is to generate not only colors, but also struc- ture along output surfaces: given an exemplar indicating 'solid' and 'empty' pixels, we generate a similar pattern along the output sur- face. The core challenge is to guarantee that the pattern is not only fully connected, but also structurally sound. To achieve this goal we propose a novel formulation for on-surface by-example texture synthesis that directly works in a voxel shell around the surface. It enables efficient local updates to the pattern, letting our structural optimizer perform changes that improve the overall rigidity of the pattern.We use this technique in an iterative scheme that jointly optimizes for appearance and structural sound- ness.We consider fabricability constraints and a user-provided de- scription of a force profile that the object has to resist. Our results fully exploit the capabilities of additive manufacturing by letting users design intricate structures along surfaces. The struc- tures are complex, yet they resemble input exemplars, resulting in a modeling tool accessible to casual users.},

abstract = {In the field of Fine Art reproduction, 3D scanning plus 3D printing, combined with dedicated software, now allows to capture and reproduce the color and texture of oil paintings. However, for life-like reproduction of the material appearance of such paintings, the typical gloss and translucency must also be included, which is currently not the case. The aim of this paper is to elaborate on the challenges and results of capturing and reproducing oil paint gloss (next to texture and color) using a scanning and printing system. A sample was hand-made using oil paint and acrylic varnish, and its gloss was then reproduced. A gloss map of the painted sample was acquired using a high end DLSR camera and a simple acquisition protocol. Next, Oc{\'{e}} High Resolution 3D printing technology was used to create samples with spatially varying gloss. For this, two different strategies were combined: (1) multilevel half-toning of the colors was used to reproduce matte color layers, and (2) varnish was half-toned on top in increasing coverage to recreate increasing gloss levels. This paper presents an overview of the state-of-the-art literature in gloss reproduction and perception, our process of reproduction as well as the visual evaluation of the quality of the created reproduction.},

This paper presents an integrated methodology for planning of tangential path velocity, material deposition rate and temperature control of the extruded material which is deposited along curved paths. The tangential velocity along the path is smoothed and optimized while respecting the heater's and extruder's capacities, as well as the feed drives' jerk, acceleration and velocity limits. The extrusion rate is controlled proportional to the tangential path velocity while keeping the temperature of the deposited thermo-plastic material at the desired temperature by adaptively controlling current supply to the heater. The experimentally proven algorithm leads to more uniform material deposition at sharp curvatures and resulting improved dimensional accuracy of printed parts. The proposed methodology can be extended to laser and electron beam based metal printing applications.},

abstract = {In additive manufacturing (AM), slicing is typically used to manufacture 3D models, one layer after another. Yet, in recent years quite a few hardware platforms were introduced toward the use of multi-axes AM with general 3D curves as print-paths. This paper presents algorithms for the generation of such general print-paths that can potentially be used to synthesize superior 3D models using AM. In slicing, a 3D model is decomposed into a series of parallel planar sections, which in turn are (usually) decomposed into a set of piecewise linear curves used as print-paths in the AM process. The methods we propose in this work ease this restriction, namely the print-paths are no longer limited to parallel planes. Like slicing, the methods we propose achieve a complete covering of a general volume with print-paths expressed as general curves. However, and unlike slicing, the created print-paths can conform better to the 3D model, its properties, and even user input. We expect that the added flexibility and freedom in the specification of AM print-paths, as opposed to limiting them to planar curves, will enable the synthesis of 3D models (using AM) with superior properties (such as mechanical strength and surface finish). As a proof of concept, we also present examples of 3D models manufactured with a low-end AM hardware and using the algorithms described in this paper.},

abstract = {This original work proposes to investigate the transposition of crystallography rules to cubic lattice architectured materials to generate new 3D porous structures. The application of symmetry operations provides a complete and convenient way to configure the lattice architecture with only two parameters. New lattice structures were created by slipping from the conventional Bravais lattice toward non-compact complex structures. The resulting stiffness of the porous materials was thoroughly evaluated for all the combinations of architecture parameters. This exhaustive study revealed attractive structures having high specific stiffness, up to twice as large as the usual octet-truss for a given relative density. It results in a relationship between effective Young modulus and relative density for any lattice structure. It also revealed the opportunity to generate auxetic structures at will, with a controlled Poisson ratio. The collection of the elastic properties for all the cubic structures into 3D maps provides a convenient tool for lattice materials design, for research, and for mechanical engineering. The resulting mechanical properties are highly variable according to architecture, and can be easily tailored for specific applications using the simple yet powerful formalism developed in this work.},

In this paper, we use a simplification of the medial axis, the $\theta$-SMA, that is parameterized by a separation angle ($\theta$) formed by the vectors connecting a point on the medial axis to the closest points on the boundary. We present a formal characterization of the degree of simplification of the $\theta$-SMA as a function of 6, and we quantify the degree to which the simplified medial axis retains the features of the original polyhedron. We present a fast algorithm to compute an approximation of the $\theta$-SMA. It is based on a spatial subdivision scheme, and uses fast computation of a distance field and its gradient using graphics hardware. The complexity of the algorithm varies based on the error threshold that is used, and is a linear function of the input size. We have applied this algorithm to approximate the SMA of models with tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles. Its running time varies from a few seconds, for a model consisting of hundreds of triangles, to minutes for highly complex models.},

We propose here an easily implemented route to the triangulation of simple polygons through the trapezoidization of simple polygons, which is currently done in O(n log n). Then the trapezoidized polygons are triangu- lated in O(n) time. Both of those steps can be performed on polygons with holes with the same complexity. We also show in this paper that a number of problems, such as the decomposition of simple polygons into convex, star, monotone, spiral, and trapezoidal polygons and the determination of edge- vertex visibility, are linearly equivalent to the triangulation problem and therefore share the same lower bound. It is hoped that this will simplify the task of reducing the gap between the lower and upper bound for these problems.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring about a revolution in the way products are designed, manufactured, and distributed to end users. This technology has gained significant academic as well as industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties. AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example materials processing, topology optimization) generate a "positive feedback loop" effect in advancing AM. In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings, and future trends significantly to the researchers. We also discuss fundamental attributes of AM processes, evolution of the AM industry, and the affordances enabled by the emergence of AM in a variety of areas such as geometry processing, material design, and education. We conclude our paper by pointing out future directions such as the "print-it-all" paradigm, that have the potential to re-imagine current research and spawn completely new avenues for exploration.},

An {\$}r{\$}-reptiling is an {\$}r{\$}-gentiling of which all parts are mutually congruent. By applying gentilings recursively, together with a rule that defines an order on the parts, one may obtain an order in which to traverse all points within the original shape. We say such a traversal is a face-continuous space-filling curve if, at any level of recursion, the interior of the union of any set of consecutive parts is connected---that is, consecutive parts must always meet along an edge. Most famously, the isosceles right triangle admits a 2-reptiling, which forms the basis of the face-continuous Sierpinski space-filling curve; many other right triangles admit reptilings and gentilings that yield face-continuous space-filling curves as well. In this study we investigate what acute triangles admit non-trivial reptilings and gentilings, and whether these can form the basis for face-continuous space-filling curves. We derive several properties of reptilings and gentilings of acute (sometimes also obtuse) triangles, leading to the following conclusion: no face-continuous space-filling curve can be constructed on the basis of reptilings of acute triangles.},

abstract = {An algorithm for generating a toolpath for a milling machine is described. The approach to its design was interdisciplinary. The algorithm contains ideas from computer graphics and mathematics, rather than mechanical engineering alone. An artefact described by any set of curved surfaces is carved out of a workpiece in two stages. Horizontal slices are removed to reveal the roughly cut artefact, and a final pass cuts the artefact to within a preset tolerance. The toolpath might seem to be needlessly convoluted, but it has substantial advantages over less sophisticated paths. Its local complexity adapts automatically to the local complexity of the artefact, so that more attention is concentrated on those parts of the artefact which require it. At the roughing out stage, the path efficiently skips over completely worked areas without retracing them with each new horizontal slice. The path minimizes the amount of tool movement which does not cut material, and minimizes the number of occassions on which the tool reenters the material. A prototype system has been developed to demonstrate that the new approach is viable. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

The presented approach bridges coarse and fine scale, such that the complex periodic microstructures can be represented by a smooth and continuous lattice on the fine mesh. A heuristic methodology allows control of the projected topology, such that a minimum length scale on both solid and void features is ensured in the final result. Numerical examples show excellent behavior of the method, where performances of the projected designs are almost equal to the homogenization-based solutions. A significant reduction in computational cost is observed compared to conventional topology optimization approaches.},

The latter achievement designates aged individuals as optimal recipients, but concerns derive from possible age-dependent differences in KDs effectiveness. Indeed, the main factors influencing ketone bodies utilization by the brain (blood levels, transport mechanisms, catabolic enzymes) undergo developmental changes, although several reports indicate that KDs maintain some efficacy during adulthood and even during advanced aging. Encouraging results obtained in patients affected by age-related neurodegenerative diseases have prompted new interest on KDs' effect on the aging brain, also considering the poor efficacy of therapies currently used. However, recent morphological evidence in synapses of late-adult rats indicates that KDs consequences may be even opposite in different brain regions, likely depending on neuronal vulnerability to age. Thus, further studies are needed to design KDs specifically indicated for single neurodegenerative diseases, and to ameliorate the balance between beneficial and adverse effects in aged subjects. Here we review clinical and experimental data on KDs treatments, focusing on their possible use during pathological aging. Proposed mechanisms of action are also reported and discussed.},

The pocket may be an arbitrary simply-connected 2D shape bounded by straight-line segments and circular arcs. The tool path is generated by interpolating growing disks placed on the medial axis of the pocket. It starts inside the pocket and spirals out to the pocket boundary. The tool path is guaranteed to be free of self-intersections and allows machining of the pocket without tool retractions. The start point of the spiral may be chosen freely by the user anywhere within the pocket. Most importantly, the spiral tool path complies with a user-specified maximum cutting width. The output of our algorithm is a G1-continuous spiral path. However, in a post-processing step, a properly adapted variant of the recent "PowerApx" package [Heimlich M, Held M. Biarc approximation, simplification and smoothing of polygonal curves by means of Voronoi-based tolerance bands.

abstract = {The viability of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) as an Additive Manufacturing (AM) method is improved by including discrete carbon fibers in the polymer feedstock. The resulting carbon fiber polymer composite enhances mechanical and thermal properties, where improvements are directly related to the orientation of the carbon fibers within the extruded polymer composite. Fiber orientation in the polymer melt is affected by the flow field which is defined by the melt flow geometry including flow in the nozzle convergence and extrudate swell. This paper presents a computational approach for modeling the polymer melt flow and the associated effects of nozzle geometry and extrudate swell on fiber orientation in the extruded polymer. The finite element method is used to evaluate Stokes flow in the axisymmetric flow field of an FFF nozzle. Fiber orientation tensors are calculated throughout the fluid domain using the Orthotropic Fitted Closure and the Folgar-Tucker isotropic fiber interaction model. The radial and axial modulus of the extruded polymer is then calculated from fiber orientation tensors within the composite at the nozzle exit. Fiber orientation along the extrudate axis is shown to increase due to elongation flow within the nozzle convergence zone and decrease in the extrudate swell such that the modulus of elasticity of the extruded polymer is moderately affected by extrudate swell and substantially affected by the nozzle geometry.},

abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication is an additive manufacturing process by which a 3D object is created from plastic filament. The filament is pushed through a hot nozzle where it melts. The nozzle deposits plastic layer after layer to create the final object. This process has been popularized by the RepRap community. Several printers feature multiple extruders, allowing objects to be formed from multiple materials or colors. The extruders are mounted side by side on the printer carriage. However, the print quality suffers when objects with color patterns are printed - a disappointment for designers interested in 3D printing their colored digital models. The most severe issue is the oozing of plastic from the idle extruders: Plastics of different colors bleed onto each other giving the surface a smudged aspect, excess strings oozing from the extruder deposit on the surface, and holes appear due to this missing plastic. Fixing this issue is difficult: increasing the printing speed reduces oozing but also degrades surface quality - on large prints the required speed level become impractical. Adding a physical mechanism increases cost and print time as extruders travel to a cleaning station. Instead, we rely on software and exploit degrees of freedom of the printing process. We introduce three techniques that complement each other in improving the print quality significantly. We first reduce the impact of oozing plastic by choosing a better azimuth angle for the printed part. We build a disposable rampart in close proximity of the part, giving the extruders the opportunity to wipe oozing strings and refill with hot plastic. We finally introduce a toolpath planner avoiding and hiding most of the defects due to oozing, and seamlessly integrating the rampart. We demonstrate our technique on several challenging multiple color prints, and show that our tool path planner improves the surface finish of single color prints as well. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum {\textcopyright} 2014 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.

abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies fabricate objects layer by layer, adding material on top of already solidified layers. A key challenge is to ensure that there is always something below the layer being fabricated: otherwise added material simply falls under the effect of gravity -- this is a critical issue with most technologies. 

This difficulty is typically treated differently for the interior and the exterior of an object: the exterior is supported through structures akin to scaffoldings that are removed afterwards, while the interior volume is filled with a sparse, self-supporting infill pattern. The infill acts as a support for the tops and also provides mechanical strength to the final print. However, as objects grow in size even sparse infills become prohibitively expensive in time and material usage, and if made too sparse they no longer provide the required support. This prevents printing large objects with empty interiors.

In this work we investigate how to compute as large as possible self-supporting empty cavities. Our technique is based on an iterated geometric carving algorithm, that is fast to compute and produces nested sets of inner walls. The walls have exactly the minimal printable thickness of the manufacturing process everywhere. Remarkably, our technique only manipulates two consecutive slices of the model at a time, sweeping through the model along the vertical direction, from top to bottom. 

We discuss an efficient, robust implementation in details, based on a filtered polygonal medial axis extraction and an exact polygon offsetting technique. 
Using our approach, we can print large parts on filament printers using as little as a single filament thickness, providing on order of magnitude reduction in print time and material use while $\backslash$textit{\{}guaranteeing{\}} printability.},

The graded honeycombs are manufactured using Kevlar woven fabric/914 epoxy prepreg using Kirigami techniques, which consist in a combination of Origami and ply-cut processes. The cores are used to manufacture sandwich panels for flatwise compression and edgewise loading. The compressive modulus and compressive strength of stabilized (sandwich) honeycombs are found to be higher than those of bare honeycombs, and with density-averaged properties enhanced compared to other sandwich panels offered in the market place. The modulus and strength of graded sandwich panel under quasi-static edgewise loading vary with different failure mode mechanisms, and offer also improvements towards available panels from open literature. Edgewise impact loading shows a strong directionality of the mechanical response. When the indenter impacts the auxetic portion of the graded core, the strong localization of the damage due to the negative Poisson's ratio effect contains significantly the maximum dynamic displacement of the sandwich panel. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Huang2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by ASME. High-speed machine tools typically provide high spindle speeds and feedrates to achieve an effective material removal rate (MRR). However, it is not possible to realize the full extent of their high-speed capabilities due to the sharp corners of toolpaths which are introduced by conventional machining strategies, such as contour- and direction-parallel toolpaths. To address this limitation, spiral toolpaths that can reduce the magnitude of sudden direction changes have been developed in previous researches. Nevertheless, for some pockets, the average radial cutting width is significantly decreased while the total length of the toolpath is significantly increased as compared to contour- and directionparallel toolpath. In this situation, spiral toolpath may take more machining time. To overcome these drawbacks, an aggressive spiral toolpath generation method based on the medial axis (MA) transformation is proposed in machining pocket without islands inside, which refers to no additional material inside the counter. The salient feature of this work is that it integrates the advantages of both conventional contour-parallel machining strategy and the existing spiral toolpath machining strategy. The cutting width at each MA point is determined based on the diameter of the locally inscribed circle (LIC) of the MA point and the topological structure of MA. A distance-constrained contour determination algorithm is utilized to calculate the toolpath for each pass.

abstract = {This paper deals with the fast computation of straight skeletons of planar straight-line graphs (PSLGs) at an industrial-strength level. We discuss both the theoretical foun-dations of our algorithm and the engineering aspects of our implementation Bone. Our investigation starts with an analysis of the triangulation-based algorithm by Aichholzer and Aurenhammer and we prove the existence of flip-event-free Steiner triangulations. This result motivates a careful generalization of motorcycle graphs such that their inti-mate geometric connection to straight skeletons is maintained. Based on the generalized motorcycle graph, we devise a non-procedural characterization of straight skeletons of PSLGs and we discuss how to obtain a discretized version of a straight skeleton by means of graphics rendering. Most importantly, this generalization allows us to present a fast and easy-to-implement straight-skeleton algorithm. We implemented our algorithm in C ++ based on floating-point arithmetic. Extensive benchmarks with our code Bone demonstrate an O(n log n) time complexity and O(n) memory footprint on 22 300 datasets of diverse characteristics. This is a linear factor better than the implementation provided by CGAL 4.0, which shows an O(n 2 log n) time complexity and an O(n 2) memory footprint; the CGAL code has been the only fully-functional straight-skeleton code so far. In particular, on datasets with ten thousand vertices, Bone requires about 0.2–0.6 seconds instead of 4–7 minutes consumed by the CGAL code, and Bone uses only 20 MB heap memory instead of several gigabytes. We conclude our paper with a discussion of the engineering aspects and principles that make Bone reliable enough to compute the straight skeleton of datasets comprising a few million vertices on a desktop computer.},

abstract = {The onset of affordable AM printers has democratized digital manufacturing and enabled rapid growth of the AM industry. The recent advancement of AM technology has allowed for fabrication of highly complex parts that were difficult to produce using traditional manufacturing techniques. However, designers and novice users of additive technologies often lack the awareness of manufacturing considerations leading to lower quality parts and print failures. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an automated system that can analyze and correct designs before they are sent for fabrication so that wasteful iterations of build–test–redesign can be minimized. This paper outlines fundamental geometric reasoning algorithms to enable 3D print quality assessment. The developed algorithms computationally recognize potential printing problems in a given 3D model and suggest automatic local geometric changes to the 3D model to rectify the identified printing problems. The potential problems are identified using variations of shape diameter function and morphological operations. Also, a physics-based mesh deformation scheme is developed to make localized corrections to slices for improving printability. The utility of the developed approach has been demonstrated on both 2D slice and 3D model level corrections.},

abstract = {Many displays are basically bilevel in nature with individual display cells, all of the same size, arranged in a rectangular array. We present a survey of processing techniques for presenting continuous tone still images on such displays. Four techniques are covered in detail while several others are covered briefly. All the techniques achieve the subjective effect of continuous tone by properly controlling only the spatial density of bilevel display states. The processing techniques consist of dividing an image into picture elements and comparing the intensity of each element with a threshold value. If the element intensity is greater than the threshold, the corresponding display cell is set to the bright state; otherwise, the cell is set to the dark state. In the ordered-dither technique, the threshold is spatially dependent, i.e., it is determined only by the coordinates of the element being processed. In the remaining three techniques, constrained average, dynamic threshold, and minimized average error, the threshold is determined by values of elements close to the one currently being processed. The latter three thus require more processing and more storage than the first, but allow some edge emphasis. Images processed by all the described techniques are exhibited. {\textcopyright} 1976 Academic Press, Inc.},

However, AM still suffers from support material waste during the fabrication process when overhanging features exist. Plenty of research has been carried out for minimising support usage. However, former studies only focused on the optimisation for a single part fabrication. In this paper, a four-step strategy of multi-part production for reducing support consumption in AM is proposed. When printing a group of parts in the same build vat or chamber, the proposed strategy optimises the print orientation for each part, combines every two parts based on the geometries, proposes several possible multi-part combinations, and then selects the optimal part positions for fabrication. Two case studies are carried out for verification. The results show that the four-step strategy can significantly reduce the support waste and total fabrication time.},

First, an adaptive slicing considering both surface quality and building time is proposed for following tool path generation. Second, a hybrid tool path strategy is introduced to improve the boundary contours accuracy. This step is an adaptive process to choose an appropriate proportional relationship between the two types of tool paths according to the specific fabrication requirements. For further improvement, a tool path adjustment is employed on the original tool paths. A case study of a sliced layer is used to verify the feasibility and advantage of the proposed method.}

abstract = {The emergence of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies brings in the reduction of material consumption in terms of avoiding the repeated fabrication of dies as well as comparatively high material efficiency. However, despite of widespread application and evident advantages over conventional manufacturing techniques, AM still suffers from long lead time and redundant material usage when fabricating large-volume solid objects. This fact would definitely restrict the diffusion of AM technology. Based on this, a design strategy is proposed in this paper from the perspective of process planning focusing on the material consumption in additive manufacturing of relatively large-volume solid parts. Instead of processing the digital models directly, the sliced data of digital models is adopted for the design and optimization, and finally outputting the paths driving the AM machine to realize the practical fabrication. The sliced contours of the model are obtained based on a given layer thickness at first. Subsequently, the areas to be filled on each layer are determined according to the input contours and the self-supporting capability of the material. The interior regions confined by the generated internal contours do not need to be filled necessarily because they have no effect on the parts' geometry and the materials can be saved accordingly. At last, a skeleton-based path planning method is utilized to address the long and narrow geometry to improve the deposition performance and surface quality. Several tests are used to verify the proposed strategy and the results show its effectiveness and feasibility in reducing the material consumption, enabling AM to be a more environmental friendly and sustainable manufacturing method.},

abstract = {Extrusion-based layered deposition is one of the widely used additive manufacturing (AM) technologies due to its flexibility and capability in producing prototypes without geometrical complexity limitations. One of the most important steps in determining the part quality and build time is the path planning, where the trajectory for guiding the extruder is defined by various aspects prior to actual deposition. In this paper, a novel methodology is presented to generate the deposition path for the extrusion-based AM of thin-walled parts, which is difficult to obtain desirable deposition quality using general filling paths. A wavy path pattern is adopted to fill the long and narrow cross-sections that are obtained from the slicing procedure of the thin-walled parts. This novel filling pattern can bring in better deposition results and has more excellence in enhancing the efficiency. The algorithms are proposed for the generation of wavy paths at first. Then, several implementations and optimisation methods are proposed to address some issues and extend its application. Finally, two cases are used to verify the developed methodology, and the comparison analysis demonstrates its evident advantages over traditional filling path in the fabrication efficiency for the extrusion-based additive fabrication of thin-walled objects. {\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {Notwithstanding the widespread use and large number of advantages over traditional subtractive manufacturing techniques, the application of additive manufacturing technologies is currently limited by the undesirable fabricating efficiency, which has attracted attentions from a wide range of areas, such as fabrication method, material improvement, and algorithm optimization. As a critical step in the process planning of additive manufacturing, path planning plays a significant role in affecting the build time by means of determining the paths for the printing head's movement. So a novel path filling pattern for the deposition of extrusion–based additive manufacturing is developed in this paper, mainly to avoid the retraction during the deposition process, and hence the time moving along these retracting paths can be saved and the discontinuous deposition can be avoided as well. On the basis of analysis and discussion of the reason behind the occurrence of retraction in the deposition process, a path planning strategy called “go and back” is presented to avoid the retraction issue. The “go and back” strategy can be adopted to generate a continuous extruder path for simple areas with the start point being connected to the end point. So a sliced layer can be decomposed into several simple areas and the sub-paths for each area are generated based on the proposed strategy. All of these obtainable sub-paths can be connected into a continuous path with proper selection of the start point. By doing this, separated sub-paths are joined with each other to decrease the number of the startup and shutdown process for the extruder, which is beneficial for the enhancement of the deposition quality and the efficiency. Additionally, some methodologies are proposed to further optimize the generated non-retraction paths. At last, several cases are used to test and verify the developed methodology and the comparisons with conventional path filling patterns are conducted. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the retraction motions and is especially beneficial for the high efficient additive manufacturing without compromise on the part resistance.},

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) professionals often throw around the notion that complexity is free. Indeed, complexity is much easier and potentially cheaper to achieve through AM than through traditional manufacturing, but it is not free. Upon attempting to manufacture complex designs, it is quickly found that certain features, or topologies, are more manufacturable than others, with sacrificial support material required for many complex designs. This will significantly increase machining costs. Topology Optimization (TO) is a freeform computational design methodology which is ideal for designing lightweight structures through a combination of modeling and rigorous optimization. While AM can realize many complex topologies, there still remain AM manufacturing limitations (such as overhangs), which require customized TO design algorithms beyond freeform TO. In this work, a projection-based TO methodology is presented to design for 3D self-supporting structures – i.e. structures that do not require sacrificial support material. The foundation of the presented methodology is a 2D overhang projection framework. In addition to expanding the methodology to three dimensions, the algorithm is drastically improved through (1) adopting a new overhang mapping scheme which allows for exact specification of allowable overhang angle, and (2) implementing an adjoint approach to sensitivity calculations to speed up calculation drastically and to allow for scalability. Using several examples, it is shown that the presented methodology generates self-supporting structures (given a prescribed printable overhang angle) which are entirely manufacturable without any added sacrificial support material. Upon printing a couple topologies with mixed success, further customization of the algorithm is proposed for situations where multiple directional-dependent overhang angles are possible in a single AM system.},

Also it is desirable to minimise the number of tool retractions. This work describes three different methods to generate fractal-based CNC toolpath for area filling of a closed curve with minimum or zero tool retractions. Design/methodology/approach This work describes three different methods to generate fractal-based CNC toolpath for area filling of a closed curve with minimum or zero tool retractions. In first method a large fractal square is placed over the outer boundary and then rest of the unwanted curve is trimmed out. To reduce the number of retractions, ends of the trimmed toolpath are connected in such a way that overlapping within the existing toolpath is avoided. In second method the trimming of the fractal is similar to the first method but the ends of trimmed toolpath are connected such that the overlapping is found at the boundaries only. The toolpath in third method is a combination of fractal and zigzag curves. This toolpath is capable of filling a given connected area in a single pass without any tool retraction and toolpath overlap within a tolerance value equal to stepover of the toolpath. Findings The generated toolpath has several applications in Additive Manufacturing and constant Z-height surface finishing. Experiments have been performed to verify the toolpath by depositing material by Hybrid Layered Manufacturing process. Research limitations/implications Third toolpath method is suitable for the Hybrid Layered Manufacturing process only because the toolpath overlapping tolerance may not be enough for other Additive Manufacturing processes. Originality/value Development of a CNC toolpath for Additive Manufacturing Specifically Hybrid Layered Manufacturing which can completely fill any arbitrary connected area in single pass while maintaining a constant stepover.},

abstract = {A novel tissue scaffold design technique has been proposed with controllable heterogeneous architecture design suitable for additive manufacturing processes. The proposed layer-based design uses a bi-layer pattern of radial and spiral layers consecutively to generate functionally gradient porosity, which follows the geometry of the scaffold. The proposed approach constructs the medial region from the medial axis of each corresponding layer, which represents the geometric internal feature or the spine. The radial layers of the scaffold are then generated by connecting the boundaries of the medial region and the layer's outer contour. To avoid the twisting of the internal channels, reorientation and relaxation techniques are introduced to establish the point matching of ruling lines. An optimization algorithm is developed to construct sub-regions from these ruling lines. Gradient porosity is changed between the medial region and the layer's outer contour. Iso-porosity regions are determined by dividing the sub-regions peripherally into pore cells and consecutive iso-porosity curves are generated using the iso-points from those pore cells. The combination of consecutive layers generates the pore cells with desired pore sizes. To ensure the fabrication of the designed scaffolds, the generated contours are optimized for a continuous, interconnected, and smooth deposition path-planning. A continuous zig-zag pattern deposition path crossing through the medial region is used for the initial layer and a biarc fitted iso-porosity curve is generated for the consecutive layer with C1 continuity. The proposed methodologies can generate the structure with gradient (linear or non-linear), variational or constant porosity that can provide localized control of variational porosity along the scaffold architecture. The designed porous structures can be fabricated using additive manufacturing processes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Various methods have been developed for producing hierarchical geometrical structures. Recently, fractal structures have been manufactured using a 3D printing technique that involves computer aided design data. In this study, we confirmed the accuracy of geometrical structures when Koch curve-like fractal structures with zero to three generations were printed using a 3D printer. The fractal dimension was analyzed using a box-counting method. This analysis indicated that the fractal dimension of the third generation hierarchical structure was approximately the same as that of the ideal Koch curve.

However, fabricated parts have relatively inferior surface roughness compared to liquid material type process such as SL (Stereolithography). In this research, effects of fabrication parameters such as the gap between nozzle and substrate, inflow speed of filament material and heating moving speed of nozzle on the FDM-fabricated line figuration was investigated experimentally. The extruded line figurations such as width, thickness and cross-sectional shapes were examined. An empirical formula of the line fabrication for fabrication parameters was made based on the experimental results. Moreover, effect of line fabrication distance on the surface roughness was studied.},

abstract = {The fabrication flexibility of 3D printing has sparked a lot of interest in designing structures with spatially graded material properties. In this paper, we propose a new type of density graded structure that is particularly designed for 3D printing systems based on filament extrusion. In order to ensure high-quality fabrication results, extrusion-based 3D printing requires not only that the structures are self-supporting, but also that extrusion toolpaths are continuous and free of self-overlap. The structure proposed in this paper, called CrossFill, complies with these requirements. In particular, CrossFill is a self-supporting foam structure, for which each layer is fabricated by a single, continuous and overlap-free path of material extrusion. Our method for generating CrossFill is based on a space-filling surface that employs spatially varying subdivision levels. Dithering of the subdivision levels is performed to accurately reproduce a prescribed density distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossFill on a number of experimental tests and applications.},

Initially an overall framework of modelling and data transfer that includes controlled porosity information apart from the external geometry of porous objects and its transfer for LM is presented. A novel raster path generation methodology using space-filling fractal curves for LM of porous models is presented later. Specifically, the geometry and space-filling character-istics of fractal curves are studied for application to raster tool path generation in LM. Finally, boundary-constrained raster patterns are generated based on the surface geometry. The resulting data can be translated into a machine language file that can be imported by an LM system. Case studies are presented to illustrate the efficacy of this approach.},

However, existing topology optimization approaches do not consider AM-specific limitations during the design process, resulting in designs that are not self-supporting. This leads to additional effort and costs in post-processing and use of sacrificial support structures. To overcome this difficulty, this paper presents a topology optimization formulation that includes a simplified AM fabrication model implemented as a layerwise filtering procedure. Unprintable geometries are effectively excluded from the design space, resulting in fully self-supporting optimized designs. The procedure is demonstrated on numerical examples involving compliance minimization, eigenfrequency maximization and compliant mechanism design. Despite the applied restrictions, in suitable orientations fully printable AM-restrained designs matched the performance of reference designs obtained by conventional topology optimization.},

Despite the associated opportunities for innovation, the use of support material also introduces a series of limitations: additional material cost, cost of removal of support material, potential contamination of biocompatible materials, and entrapment of support material within cellular structures. This work presents a strategy for minimising the use of support material by comparing the geometric limits of an additive manufacture process to the build angles that exist within a proposed geometry. This method generates a feasibility map of the feasible build orientations for a proposed geometry with a given process. The method is applied to polyhedra that are suitable for close packing to identify space-filling tessellated structures that can be selfsupporting. The integrity of an FDM process is quantified, and using the associated feasibility map, self-supporting polyhedra are manufactured. These polyhedra are integrated with non-trivial geometries to achieve a reduction in consumed material of approximately 50{\%}. {\textcopyright} (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

In this work, we present a novel optimization strategy for designing functionally graded cellular structures with desired mechanical properties. This approach is mainly by generating variable-density gyroid structure and then performing graded structure optimization. Firstly, the geometric properties of the original gyroid structures are analyzed, and the continuity and connectivity of the structures are optimized by adding a penalty function. Then, a homogenization method is used to obtain mechanical properties of gyroid-based cellular structures through a scaling law as a function of their relative densities. Secondly, the scaling law is added directly into the structure optimization algorithm to compute the optimal density distribution in part being optimized. Thirdly, the density mapping and interpolation approach are used to map the output of structure optimization into the parametric gyroid structure which results in an optimum lightweight lattice structure with uniformly varying densities across the design space. Lastly, the effectiveness and robustness of the optimized results are analyzed through finite element analysis and experiments.},

abstract = {The use of cobalt chromium (CoCr) in orthopaedic joint replacement shields the peri-implant bone stress, contributing to a premature loosening of the implants. In order to reduce the need for revision surgeries, light weight implants with tailored functionalities need to be developed. In this study, the compressive mechanical properties of laser-melted CoCr cellular structures with a pillar octahedral architecture [0° ± 45°] were investigated. Four types of graded cellular structures, based on grading orientations along radial and longitudinal planes, were manufactured using selective laser melting techniques. The cellular structures in this study have the mechanical properties (E = 2.3–3.1 GPa, $\sigma$ = 113–523 MPa) compatible with bone structures. Grading a porosity of the CoCr cellular structures provides a greater stress transfer to the proximal peri-implant area. The axially graded cellular structures demonstrated significant reduction of the peri-implant stress shielding. Incorporation of CoCr graded cellular structures into a structure like femoral stems is expected to have the potential to reduce the revision surgeries.},

abstract = {As foams having hierarchical mechanical properties, functionally graded porous materials (FGPMs) can satisfy multifold functional constraints whilst minimizing weight. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for goal-driven design and fabrication of open-cell FGPMs with tailored elasticity distributions. To achieve the continuity in both structural geometry and mechanical properties, irregularly smooth porous structures, which have naturally realistic appearance, are designed by combining 3D Voronoi diagrams and skeleton-based implicit surfaces. A procedural modeling method integrating additive manufacturing (AM) is developed for avoiding the FGPM full representations which consume tremendous computational memory. For easily mapping the graded porous structures to yield tailored elasticity distributions, a mapping model from the elasticity distribution to the density field is formulated. The method is experimentally and numerically validated. Additionally, the compression tests showed the superior mechanical performance compared to straight-beam-based foams, and the stiffness and strength of the foam are found to be improved as a result of FGPMs. This research opens up a new route of tailoring the novel foams.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by ASME. In the present work, a new approach for designing graded lattice structures is developed under the moving morphable components/voids (MMC/MMV) topology optimization framework. The essential idea is to make a coordinate perturbation to the topology description functions (TDF) that are employed for the description of component/void geometries in the design domain. Then, the optimal graded structure design can be obtained by optimizing the coefficients in the perturbed basis functions. Our numerical examples show that the proposed approach enables a concurrent optimization of both the primitive cell and the graded material distribution in a straightforward and computationally effective way. Moreover, the proposed approach also shows its potential in finding the optimal configuration of complex graded lattice structures with a very small number of design variables employed under various loading conditions and coordinate systems.},

abstract = {Adaptive slicing is an important computational task required in the layer-based manufacturing process. Its purpose is to find an optimal trade-off between the fabrication time (number of layers) and the surface quality (geometric deviation error). Most of the traditional adaptive slicing algorithms are computationally expensive or only based on local evaluation of errors. To tackle these problems, we introduce a method to efficiently generate slicing plans by a new metric profile that can characterize the distribution of deviation errors along the building direction. By generalizing the conventional error metrics, the proposed metric profile is a density function of deviation errors, which measures the global deviation errors rather than the in-plane local geometry errors used in most prior methods. Slicing can be efficiently evaluated based on metric profiles in contrast to the expensive computation on models in boundary-representation. An efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming is proposed to find the best slicing plan. Our adaptive slicing method can also be applied to models with weighted features and can serve as the inner loop to search the best building direction. The performance of our approach is demonstrated by experimental tests on different examples.},

Here the user paints elasticity on a 3D model to create a flexible figurine. Model: Moomin (thing:1173447) by Jeroentjj. Abstract Microstructures at the scale of tens of microns change the physical properties of objects, making them lighter or more flexible. While traditionally difficult to produce, additive manufacturing now lets us physically realize such microstruc-tures at low cost. In this paper we propose to study procedural, aperiodic microstructures inspired by Voronoi open-cell foams. The absence of regularity affords for a simple approach to grade the foam geometry — and thus its mechanical properties — within a target object and its surface. Rather than requiring a global optimization process, the microstructures are di-rectly generated to exhibit a specified elastic behavior. The implicit evaluation is akin to procedural textures in com-puter graphics, and locally adapts to follow the elasticity field. This allows very detailed structures to be generated in large objects without having to explicitly produce a full representation — mesh or voxels — of the complete object: the structures are added on the fly, just before each object slice is manufactured. We study the elastic behavior of the microstructures and pro-vide a complete description of the procedure generating them. We explain how to determine the geometric parameters of the microstructures from a target elasticity, and evaluate the result on printed samples. Finally, we apply our approach to the fabrication of objects with spatially varying elasticity, in-cluding the implicit modeling of a frame following the object surface and seamlessly connecting to the microstructures.},

abstract = {3D objects, modeled using Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) tools, are traditionally represented using a boundary representation (B-rep), and typically use spline functions to parameterize these boundary surfaces. However, recent development in physical analysis, in isogeometric analysis (IGA) in specific, necessitates a volumetric parametrization of the interior of the object. IGA is performed directly by integrating over the spline spaces of the volumetric spline representation of the object. Typically, tensor-product B-spline trivariates are used to parameterize the volumetric domain. A general 3D object, that can be modeled in contemporary B-rep CAD tools, is typically represented using trimmed B-spline surfaces. In order to capture the generality of the contemporary B-rep modeling space, while supporting IGA needs, Massarwi and Elber (2016) proposed the use of trimmed trivariates volumetric elements. However, the use of trimmed geometry makes the integration process more difficult since integration over trimmed B-spline basis functions is a highly challenging task Xu et al. (2017). In this work, we propose an algorithm that precisely decomposes a trimmed B-spline trivariate into a set of (singular only on the boundary) tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that can be utilized to simplify the integration process, in IGA. The trimmed B-spline trivariate is first subdivided into a set of trimmed B{\'{e}}zier trivariates, at all its internal knots. Then, each trimmed B{\'{e}}zier trivariate, is decomposed into a set of mutually exclusive tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that precisely cover the entire trimmed domain. This process, denoted untrimming, can be performed in either the Euclidean space or the parametric space of the trivariate. We present examples of the algorithm on complex trimmed trivariates' based geometry, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying IGA over the (untrimmed) results.},

That proposed approach involves the tiling of the domain of a deformation map using copies of a tile. The resulting tiling is functionally composed into the deformation map to obtain freeform micro-structures. Such a decoupling of the micro and macro structures allows a simplified control over design parameters. Herein, we present several extensions to this micro-structure construction scheme, comprising bivariate and trivariate tiles, implicit and parametric, including with potential discontinuities. We present support for fractal-like micro-structures, with self-similarity, allow the encoding of volumetric properties and hence heterogeneity, support for shelling and capping boundary operations, random tiling and bifurcation tiling, and support for degree reduction of the result. We verify the robustness of our approach by subjecting some of our heterogeneous micro-structures to isogeometric analysis. Finally, a variety of results from an implementation of our algorithms are also presented.},

abstract = {In this paper, we formulate the generation of support structures for additive manufacturing as a topology optimization problem. Compared with usual geometric considerations based support structure design, this formulation affords mechanistic meaning to the computed support structures. Moreover, our study reveals that the topology optimization formulation generally leads to self-supporting designs without extraneous self-supporting constraints. We show the generality of the procedure by computing supports for a variety of parts in both two and three dimensions, including a complex model of the mascot of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The resulting support structures have been 3D printed, demonstrating that the computed designs can successfully be used as supports},

abstract = {Three areas, where polymer foam products are used in personal protection, are reviewed to contrast the foam micromechanisms and the use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for engineering design. For flexible open-cell foams used for seating cushions, the main deformation mechanism is cell edge bending; regular cell models can predict much of the compressive response. Hyperelastic FEA models can then predict the forces for foam indentation. For flexible closed-cell foams used in shoe midsoles, cell air compression dominates the response; diffusive air loss leads to foam deterioration with use. Hyperelastic FEA models can predict the interaction between the foam and the heelpad. Finally, for rigid closed-cell foams used in helmets, the permanent stretching and wrinkling of cell faces dominates the response. Crushable foam FEA models, which consider the yield surface and hardening, predict different responses for impacts on the road and on a kerbstone. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Today's software for laser-based additive manufacturing compensates for the finite dimensions of the laser spot by insetting the contours of a solid part. However, features having smaller dimensions are removed by this operation, which may significantly alter the structure of thin-walled parts. To avoid potential production errors, this work describes in detail an algorithmic framework that makes beam compensation more reliable by computing laser scan paths for thin features. The geometry of the features can be adjusted by the scan paths by means of five intuitive parameters, which are illustrated with examples. Benchmarks show that the scan path generation comes at a reasonable cost without altering the computational complexity of the overall beam compensation framework. The framework was applied to Selective Laser Melting (SLM) to demonstrate that it can significantly improve the robustness of additive manufacturing. Besides robustness, the framework is expected to allow further improvements to the accuracy of additive manufacturing by enabling a geometry-dependent determination of the laser parameters. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent developments in architectural design and additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have led to advances in the design and fabrication of metamaterials. We demonstrate that by precisely designing the architecture of a lattice structure and implementing the accurate and cost-effective capabilities of polymer-based AM, it is possible to create lightweight and strong structures that are highly energy absorbing, able to recover their shape after extreme deformation, and have a high strength-over-weight ratio. Largescale AM lattices with various densities of unit cells were fabricated from two different polymers. The densities of the structures ranged from 66 kg/m3 to 192 kg/m3. Compression experiments established the scaling of their strength and stiffness with their relative density and revealed that the structures were able to recover their original shape after a compression up to 70{\%} strain. The energy absorption efficiency of the structures was 11{\%} higher than Duocel{\textregistered} aluminum foam and comparable to that of aluminum honeycomb, expanded polystyrene (EPS) foams, and Skydex twin hemispheres. These unconventional mechanical properties substantiate the potential of architectural design along with additive manufacturing in various applications, not only at laboratory scale, but also at industrial level.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to systematically and critically review the literature related to process design and modeling of fused deposition modeling (FDM) and similar extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) or rapid prototyping processes. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review of the literature focusing on process design and mathematical process modeling was carried out. Findings - FDM and similar processes are among the most widely used rapid prototyping processes with growing application in finished part manufacturing. Key elements of the typical processes, including the material feed mechanism, liquefier and print nozzle; the build surface and environment; and approaches to part finishing are described. Approaches to estimating the motor torque and power required to achieve a desired filament feed rate are presented. Models of required heat flux, shear on the melt and pressure drop in the liquefier are reviewed. On leaving the print nozzle, die swelling and bead cooling are considered. Approaches to modeling the spread of a deposited road of material and the bonding of polymer roads to one another are also reviewed. Originality/value - To date, no other systematic review of process design and modeling research related to melt extrusion AM has been published. Understanding and improving process models will be key to improving system process controls, as well as enabling the development of advanced engineering material feedstocks for FDM processes.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is the process of building three-dimensional solid shapes by accumulating material laid out in sectional layers. Additive manufacturing has been recognized for enabling production of complex custom parts that are difficult to manufacture otherwise. However, the dependence on build orientation and physical limitations of printing processes invariably lead to geometric deviations between manufactured and designed shapes that are usually evaluated after manufacture. In this paper, we formalize the measurement of such deviations in terms of a printability map that simulates the printing process and partitions each printed layer into disjoint regions with distinct local measures of size. We show that manufacturing capabilities, such as printing resolution, and material specific design recommendations, such as minimal feature sizes, may be coupled in the printability map to evaluate expected deviations before manufacture. Furthermore, we demonstrate how partitions with size measures below required resolutions may be modified using properties of the medial axis transform and use the corrected printability map to construct a representation of the manufactured model. We conclude by discussing several applications of the printability map for additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {A number of strategies that enable lattice structures to be derived from Topology Optimisation (TO) results suitable for Additive Manufacturing (AM) are presented. The proposed strategies are evaluated for mechanical performance and assessed for AM specific design related manufacturing considerations. From a manufacturing stand-point, support structure requirement decreases with increased extent of latticing, whereas the design-to-manufacture discrepancies and the processing efforts, both in terms of memory requirements and time, increase. Results from Finite Element (FE) analysis for the two loading scenarios considered: intended loading, and variability in loading, provide insight into the solution optimality and robustness of the design strategies. Lattice strategies that capitalised on TO results were found to be considerably (∼40–50{\%}) superior in terms of specific stiffness when compared to the structures where this was not the case. The Graded strategy was found to be the most desirable from both the design and manufacturing perspective. The presented pros-and-cons for the various proposed design strategies aim to provide insight into their suitability in meeting the challenges faced by the AM design community.},

abstract = {Topology optimization is finding renewed interest thanks to additive manufacturing-a technology that is well-suited to fabricate the complex organic shapes and structures that often arise from topology optimization. This paper reviews the current state of topology optimization software through the redesign of a real aerospace mounting plate, focusing on manufacturing considerations that are important for additive manufacturing (AM). Twenty different commercial and educational software tools are investigated and categorized based on their capabilities. Two representative software tools are then demonstrated with well-known examples to compare user interfaces and outputs, and one is chosen to perform the mounting plate case study. We find that all of the commercially available topology optimization software packages offer similar capabilities and considerably more functionality than educational software, but only a few niche products can be tailored to specific applications and manufacturing processes. Current commercial software does not provide adequate manufacturing constraints to remove the need for manual interpretation of results for additive manufacture. A case study involving optimization of an industry-relevant component for AM is used to provide in-depth understanding of both topology optimization and manufacturing considerations in AM. Shortcomings in the existing software tools are presented, and future requirements to take advantage of the increasing AM capabilities, particularly in metals, are discussed. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2016 by ASME.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing methods provide an increasingly popular industrial means of producing complex mechanical parts when classical methods are not suitable. The main advantage of these methods is the great freedom they give designers. At the same time, theoretical and numerical topology optimization tools can be used to simulate structures with complex shapes which exactly meet the mechanical constraints while requiring as little material as possible. Combining topology optimization and additive production procedures therefore seems to be a promising approach for obtaining optimized mechanical parts. Nonetheless structures obtained via topology optimization are composed of parts of composite densities which can not produced via additive manufacturing. Only numerical structures made of full or empty spaces only can be produced by additive methods. This can be obtained at the end of computational optimization through a penalization step which gives the composite densities from 0 to 1 the values 0 or 1. This means that the final part is different from the best solution predicted by topology optimization calculations. It therefore seemed to be worth checking the validity of an engineering approach in which additive methods are used to manufacture structures based on the use of industrial topology optimization codes. Here the authors propose to study, in the case of a simple mechanical problem, that of a metal cube subjected to a given pressure, three procedures, which differed in terms of the code and type of topology optimization calculations performed and the level of penalization applied. The three structures thus obtained were then produced using additive methods. Since all three structures proved to be mechanically resistant, the three procedures used can be said to be valid. However, one of them yielded better compromise between the mechanical strength and the amount of material saved.},

We build on work in the area of meta- materials, using numerical optimization to design tiled microstruc- tures with desired properties, but with the key difference that our method designs families of related structures that can be interpo- lated to smoothly vary the material properties over a wide range. To create an object with spatially varying elastic properties, we tile the object's interior with microstructures drawn from these families, generating a different microstructure for each cell using an efficient algorithm to select compatible structures for neighboring cells. We show results computed for both 2D and 3D objects, validating sev- eral 2D and 3D printed structures using standard material tests as well as demonstrating various example applications.},

abstract = {A robust and efficient algorithm for trimming both local and global self-intersections in offset curves and surfaces is presented. Our scheme is based on the derivation of a rational distance map between the original curve or surface and its offset. By solving a bivariate polynomial equation for an offset curve or a system of three polynomial equations for an offset surface, all local and global self-intersection regions in offset curves or surfaces can be detected. The zero-set of polynomial equation(s) corresponds to the self-intersection regions. These regions are trimmed by projecting the zero-set into an appropriate parameter space. The projection operation simplifies the analysis of the zero-set, which makes the proposed algorithm numerically stable and efficient. Furthermore, in a post-processing step, a numerical marching method is employed, which provides a highly precise scheme for self-intersection elimination in both offset curves and surfaces. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using several experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is one of the most widespread additive manufacturing technique used for fabricating 3D objects without any design constraints. It is a solid-based process in which polymers material in the form of semi molten state is extruded from the nozzle to fabricate the 3D objects. In the present work, a new tool path strategy for FDM process has been developed based on Hilbert curve. Hilbert curve is a space filling fractal curve and its hausdorff dimension is two. This curve is surjective and continuous in nature. The proposed tool path from developed program are validated though simulation and experimental results. The new approach has been simulated using MATLAB computing platform. Boolean operators like intersection and subtraction are utilized for finding the intersection points for the tool path generation. A self-developed extruder system based on screw extrusion is used for the real time application of the algorithm developed. The extruder head is reconfigured to an existing CNC milling machine for printing and production purpose. Case study for different types of prototypes are also presented to demonstrate the capabilities of developed tool path algorithm.},

In this study, we propose an effective method to generate bionic porous scaffolds based on the TPMS (triply periodic minimal surface) and SF (sigmoid function) methods. First, cortical bone morphological features (e.g., pore size and distribution) were determined for several regions of a rabbit femoral bone by analyzing CT-scans. A finite element method was used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the bone at these respective areas. These results were used to place different TPMS substructures into one scaffold domain with smooth transitions. The geometrical parameters of the scaffolds were optimized to match the elastic properties of a human bone. With this proposed method, a functional gradient porous scaffold could be designed and produced by an additive manufacturing method.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method to design the periodic microstructure of a material to obtain prescribed constitutive properties. The microstructure is modelled as a truss or thin frame structure in 2 and 3 dimensions. The problem of finding the simplest possible microstructure with the prescribed elastic properties can be called an inverse homogenization problem, and is formulated as an optimization problem of finding a microstructure with the lowest possible weight which fulfils the specified behavioral requirements. A full ground structure known from topology optimization of trusses is used as starting guess for the optimization algorithm. This implies that the optimal microstructure of a base cell is found from a truss or frame structure with 120 possible members in the 2-dimensional case and 2016 possible members in the 3-dimensional case. The material parameters are found by a numerical homogenization method, using Finite-Elements to model the representative base cell, and the optimization problem is solved by an optimality criteria method. Numerical examples in two and three dimensions show that it is possible to design materials with many different properties using base cells modelled as truss or frame works. Hereunder is shown that it is possible to tailor extreme materials, such as isotropic materials with Poisson's ratio close to - 1, 0 and 0.5, by the proposed method. Some of the proposed materials have been tested as macro models which demonstrate the expected behaviour. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Layered manufacturing inherently suffers from staircase defects along surfaces that are gently slopped with respect to the build direction. Reducing the slice thickness improves the situation but never resolves it completely as flat layers remain a poor approximation of the true surface in these regions. In addition, reducing the slice thickness largely increases the print time. In this work we focus on a simple yet effective technique to improve the print accuracy for layered manufacturing by filament deposition. Our method works with standard three-axis 3D filament printers (e.g. the typical, widely available 3D printers), using standard extrusion nozzles. It better reproduces the geometry of sloped surfaces without increasing the print time. Our key idea is to perform a local anti-aliasing, working at a sub-layer accuracy to produce slightly curved deposition paths and reduce approximation errors. This is inspired by Computer Graphics anti-aliasing techniques which consider sub-pixel precision to treat aliasing effects. We show that the necessary deviation in height compared to standard slicing is bounded by half the layer thickness. Therefore, the height changes remain small and plastic deposition remains reliable. We further split and order paths to minimize defects due to the extruder nozzle shape, avoiding any change to the existing hardware. We apply and analyze our approach on 3D printed examples, showing that our technique greatly improves surface accuracy and silhouette quality while keeping the print time nearly identical.},

abstract = {Filament fused fabrication is the method of choice for printing 3D models at low cost, and is the de-facto standard for hobbyists, makers and schools. Unfortunately, filament printers cannot truly reproduce colored objects. The best current techniques rely on a form of dithering exploiting occlusion, that was only demonstrated for shades of two base colors and that behaves differently depending on surface slope. We explore a novel approach for 3D printing colored objects, capable of creating controlled gradients of varying sharpness. Our technique exploits off-the-shelves nozzles that are designed to mix multiple filaments in a small melting chamber, obtaining intermediate colors once the mix is stabilized. We exploit this property to produce color gradients. We divide each input layer into a set of sublayers, each having a different constant color. By locally changing the thickness of the sublayers, we change the color that is perceived at a given location. By optimizing the choice of colors of each sublayer, we further improve quality and allow the use of different numbers of input filaments. We demonstrate our results by building a functional color printer using low cost, off-the-shelves components. Using our tool a user can paint a 3D model and directly produce its physical counterpart, using any material and color available for fused filament fabrication.},

abstract = {The build orientation is one the most influential factors on material properties in additively manufactured parts. Advanced applications, such as lattice structures optimized for lightweight, often rely on small safety margins and are, hence, particularly affected, but research has not gone far beyond the pure empirical characterization. The focus of this paper is to investigate in detail the influence of anisotropy induced through fabrication on the mechanical performance and build orientation of whole structures when subject to optimization. First, a material property model for both compression and tension states is formulated. Then, the Generalized Optimality Criteria method is extended for fixed topology lattice structures with respect to constraints in displacement, stress, and Euler buckling. The two latter are formulated as local constraints that are handled in combination with Fully-Stressed Design recursion. The results reveal significant safety threads likely leading to premature failure when using properties from one-directional tests, as is so far the case, rather than the full anisotropy model developed herein. If used inversely, the algorithm yields the optimal orientation of a structure on the build platform, allowing further weight reduction while maintaining the mechanical properties.},

abstract = {One crucial component of the additive manufacturing software toolchain is a class of geometric algorithms known as “slicers.” The purpose of the slicer is to compute a parametric toolpath and associated commands, which direct an additive manufacturing system to produce a physical realization of a three-dimensional input model. Existing slicing algorithms operate by application of geometric transformations upon the input geometry in order to produce the toolpath. In this paper we introduce a new implicit slicing algorithm based on the computation of toolpaths derived from the level sets of arbitrary heuristics-based or physics-based fields defined over the input geometry. This enables computationally efficient slicing of arbitrarily complex geometries in a straight forward fashion. Additionally, the calculation of component “infill” (as a process control parameter) is explored due to its crucial effect on functional performance fields of interest such as strain and stress distributions. Several examples of the application of the proposed implicit slicer are presented. Finally, an example demonstrating improved structural performance during physical testing is presented. We conclude with remarks regarding the strengths of the implicit approach relative to existing explicit approaches, and discuss future work required in order to extend the methodology.},

abstract = {Ketogenic diets (KDs), successfully used in the therapy of paediatric epilepsy for nearly a century, have recently shown beneficial effects also in cancer, obesity, diabetes, GLUT 1 deficiencies, hypoxia-ischemia, traumatic brain injuries, and neurodegeneration. The latter achievement designates aged individuals as optimal recipients, but concerns derive from possible age-dependent differences in KDs effectiveness. Indeed, the main factors influencing ketone bodies utilization by the brain (blood levels, transport mechanisms, catabolic enzymes) undergo developmental changes, although several reports indicate that KDs maintain some efficacy during adulthood and even during advanced aging. Encouraging results obtained in patients affected by age-related neurodegenerative diseases have prompted new interest on KDs' effect on the aging brain, also considering the poor efficacy of therapies currently used. However, recent morphological evidence in synapses of late-adult rats indicates that KDs consequences may be even opposite in different brain regions, likely depending on neuronal vulnerability to age. Thus, further studies are needed to design KDs specifically indicated for single neurodegenerative diseases, and to ameliorate the balance between beneficial and adverse effects in aged subjects. Here we review clinical and experimental data on KDs treatments, focusing on their possible use during pathological aging. Proposed mechanisms of action are also reported and discussed.},

abstract = {Lattice structures with different desired physical properties are promising for a broad spectrum of applications. The availability of additive manufacturing (AM) technology has relaxed the fabricating limitation of lattice structures. However, manufacturing constraints still exist for AM-fabricated lattice structures, which have a significant influence on the printing quality and mechanical properties of lattice struts. In this paper, a design and optimization strategy is proposed for lattice structures with the consideration of manufacturability to ensure desired printing quality. The concept of manufacturable element is used to link the design and manufacturing process. A meta-model is constructed by experiments and the artificial neural network to obtain the manufacturing constraints. Sizes of struts are optimized by a bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization-based algorithm with these manufacturing constraints. An arm of quadcopter is redesigned and optimized to validate the proposed method. Its result shows that optimized heterogeneous lattice structures can improve the stiffness of the model compared to the homogeneous lattice structure and the original design. Both the Von-Mises stress and the maximum displacement are reduced without increasing the weight of designed part. And by considering the manufacturability constraints, the optimized design has been successfully fabricated by the selected additive manufacturing process.},

abstract = {We propose an optimization framework for 3D printing that seeks to save printing time and the support material required to print 3D shapes. Three-dimensional printing technology is rapidly maturing and may revolutionize how we manufacture objects. The total cost of printing, however, is governed by numerous factors which include not only the price of the printer but also the amount of material and time to fabricate the shape. Our PackMerger framework converts the input 3D watertight mesh into a shell by hollowing its inner parts. The shell is then divided into segments. The location of splits is controlled based on several parameters, including the size of the connection areas or volume of each segment. The pieces are then tightly packed using optimization. The optimization attempts to minimize the amount of support material and the bounding box volume of the packed segments while keeping the number of segments minimal. The final packed configuration can be printed with substantial time and material savings, while also allowing printing of objects that would not fit into the printer volume. We have tested our system on three different printers and it shows a reduction of 5-30{\%} of the printing time while simultaneously saving 15-65{\%} of the support material. The optimization time was approximately 1 min. Once the segments are printed, they need to be assembled.},

abstract = {3D printing hardware is rapidly scaling up to output continuous mixtures of multiple materials at increasing resolution over ever larger print volumes. This poses an enormous computational chal- lenge: large high-resolution prints comprise trillions of voxels and petabytes of data and simply modeling and describing the input with spatially varying material mixtures at this scale is challeng- ing. Existing 3D printing software is insufficient; in particular, most software is designed to support only a few million primitives, with discrete material choices per object. We present OpenFab, a programmable pipeline for synthesis of multi-material 3D printed objects that is inspired by RenderMan and modern GPU pipelines. The pipeline supports procedural evaluation of geometric detail and material composition, using shader-like fablets, allowing models to be specified easily and efficiently. We describe a streaming archi- tecture for OpenFab; only a small fraction of the final volume is stored in memory and output is fed to the printer with little startup delay. We demonstrate it on a variety of multi-material objects. CR},

abstract = {Metamaterials are inherently advantageous in achieving designable auxeticity since their Poisson' ratios are determined by the geometry of their unit cells. A family of auxetic metamaterials was created by computer-aided design (CAD) and dual-material three-dimensional (3D) printing. The effects of material selections and stiff material fraction on the Poisson's ratio, equivalent Young's Modulus, and maximum volume reduction were investigated. The results from finite element analysis (FEA) and mechanical testing indicated that the auxeticity and mechanical properties of this dual-material auxetic metamaterial (DMAM) are distinctly different from those of traditional single-material auxetic metamaterials (SMAMs). The interesting properties of DMAMs could be valuable to various engineering applications such as smart materials, biomedical components, and shock-resistant components.},

abstract = {This paper presents a level set-based topology optimization method considering the overhang constraint in additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Though the combination of the topology optimization and AM shows a promising potential and high design flexibility, there are still certain limitations. The overhang constraint is one of the major issues that need to be considered in the design stage. It requires the inclination angles of structural downward-facing surfaces to be larger than a given lower bound, so as to prevent the structure from warping or collapsing during the AM process. We propose a new form of overhang constraint in the level set framework, which is expressed as a single domain integral instead of point-wise constraints. This domain integral form facilitates the detection of overhang constraint violation. The shape derivative of the overhang constraint is derived by using the signed distance property of the level set function. The proposed method is capable of dealing with constraints with different minimum overhang angles. Theoretically, it allows the optimization to proceed from an arbitrary structural layout, without the need to satisfy the overhang constraint in the initial design. Several numerical examples are given to show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. It is seen in these examples that the overhang constraint is satisfied mainly by adjusting the local shape of structural members violating the overhang constraint during the optimization process. Thus, the overhang angle constrained optimization can generate similar load paths as in conventional optimal designs in most cases, without significantly worsening the structural stiffness.},

A shape metamorphosis technology is developed to interpolate a prototype microstructure (PM) to generate a family of graded microstructures (GMs) that are connectable to each other in a natural way since they present similar topological features and material distribution patterns at their edges. The concurrent design optimizes configuration of the PM at the microscopic level and coordinates the compatible generated GMs at the macroscopic level in a double-loop manner, which ensures a sufficiently large design space. Numerical examples demonstrate that, compared to the one-scale design strategy, i.e. the macrostructure topology optimization and the homogeneous microstructure design method, the proposed approach is able to produce remarkably improved optimized solutions. Furthermore, the obtained structures show good manufacturability to which the additive manufacturing technology is applicable without extensive post-modification.},

A two-scale optimization is performed, where not only is the structural configuration optimized, but the effective properties of the constituent material are also designed by optimizing the configuration of the periodically-arranged microstructures. In this way, the approach can simultaneously generate optimized material distribution patterns as well as optimized materials. Due to the fact that the level set method produces material-void solutions only, the obtained material is uniformly distributed over the material regions of the structure in a strict sense. Three numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed method. The obtained optimal solutions illustrate that whether to design material cells or to optimize structural configurations to achieve the best structural performance would be problem dependent, and thus further demonstrate the necessity and validity of the integrated design scheme.},

The optimization aims at achieving a quadtree structure with the highest mechanical stiffness, where the edges in the quadtree are interpreted as structural elements carrying mechanical loads. We formulate quadtree optimization as a continuous material distribution problem. The discrete design variables (i.e., to refine or not to refine) are replaced by continuous variables on multiple levels in the quadtree hierarchy. In discrete quadtree optimization, a cell is only eligible for refinement if its parent cell has been refined. We propose a continuous analogue to this dependency for continuous multi-level design variables, and integrate it in the iterative optimization process. Our results show that the continuously optimized quadtree structures perform much stiffer than uniform patterns and the heuristically optimized counterparts. We demonstrate the use of adaptive structures as lightweight infill for 3D printed parts, where uniform geometric patterns have been typically used in practice.},

abstract = {Additively manufactured parts are often composed of two sub-structures, a solid shell forming their exterior and a porous infill occupying the interior. To account for this feature this paper presents a novel method for generating simultaneously optimized shell and infill in the context of minimum compliance topology optimization. Our method builds upon two recently developed approaches that extend density-based topology optimization: A coating approach to obtain an optimized shell that is filled uniformly with a prescribed porous base material, and an infill approach which generates optimized, non-uniform infill within a prescribed shell. To evolve the shell and infill concurrently, our formulation assigns two sets of design variables: One set defines the base and the coating, while the other set defines the infill structures. The resulting intermediate density distributions are unified by a material interpolation model into a physical density field, upon which the compliance is minimized. Enhanced by an adapted robust formulation for controlling the minimum length scale of the base, our method generates optimized shell–infill composites suitable for additive manufacturing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on numerical examples, and analyse the influence of different design specifications.},

Moreover, fabrication-specific constraints need to be considered to enable printability. To address these challenges, we present a scalable system for generating 3D objects using topology optimization, which allows to efficiently evolve the topology of high-resolution solids towards printable and light-weight-high-resistance structures. To achieve this, the system is equipped with a high-performance GPU solver which can efficiently handle models comprising several millions of elements. A minimum thickness constraint is built into the optimization process to automatically enforce printability of the resulting shapes. We further shed light on the question how to incorporate geometric shape constraints, such as symmetry and pattern repetition, in the optimization process.

Additional supporting structures can be avoided entirely in our framework. To achieve this, we introduce the usage of an adaptive rhombic grid, which is built from an input surface model. Starting from the initial sparse set of rhombic cells, via numerical optimization techniques an objective function can be improved by adaptively subdividing the rhombic grid and thus adding more walls in cells.

presents a coherent summary of the state of the art in virtual cutting
of deformable bodies, focusing on the distinct geometrical and
topological representations of the deformable body, as well as the
specific numerical discretizations of the governing equations of motion.
In particular, we discuss virtual cutting based on tetrahedral,
hexahedral and polyhedral meshes, in combination with standard,
polyhedral, composite and extended finite element discretizations. A
separate section is devoted to meshfree methods. Furthermore, we discuss
cutting-related research problems such as collision detection and haptic
rendering in the context of interactive cutting scenarios. The report is
complemented with an application study to assess the performance of
virtual cutting simulators.},

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies require innovative design paradigms and guidelines that exhaust the offered freedoms in geometry and material. The aim of the Design for Additive Manufacturing is to provide design opportunities and to enhance workpiece properties taking into account constraints of the process, e.g. kinematics and limitations of print technology. Most AM applications are constrained to three-axis movements limiting the fabrication of workpieces layer by layer to one fixed building direction only. This causes limitations of strength properties, surface quality and the need of supporting structures. Multi-axis AM enables completely new design possibilities going beyond current optimization and design strategies of conventional AM workpieces. This innovation requires multiple design and manufacturing changes in the internal and external geometry of the workpiece as well as in machine and printing head technology. This paper identifies the requirements and capabilities of multi-axis AM and presents possible solutions to overcome the identified challenges. Preliminary results for multi-axis AM are described on an exemplary workpiece.},

abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) technology can manufacture complex lattice structures, which effectively reduces the manufacturing constraint and significantly increases the design freedom for lattice structure. In this study, additive manufacturing and topology optimization are combined for designing Face Centre Cube (FCC), Vertex Cube (VC), and Edge Centre Cube (ECC) structures, which are manufactured via SLM technology. Mechanical performance is evaluated, and a Gibson-Ashby model is developed to predict the performance of the three structures including different levels of porosity. The results show that FCC and VC lattice structures have better mechanical behaviour compared with that of the ECC lattice structure; however, their energy absorption efficiency is inferior to that of the ECC lattice structure. Comparisons between various SLM built lattice structures made from 316L stainless steel prove that the performance of topology-optimized lattice structures is superior to the majority of lattice structures. This result verifies the feasibility of lattice structure unit selection via topology optimization technology. Various work conditions are simulated for topology optimization to obtain a lightweight lattice structure with optimal performance under specific conditions.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a general mathematic approach to model the microstructures of porous structures produced by additive manufacturing (AM), which will result in fractal surface topography and higher roughness that have greater influence on the performance of porous structures. Design/methodology/approach - The overall shapes of pores were modeled by triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS), and the micro-roughness details attached to the overall pore shapes were represented by Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (W-M) fractal representation, which was integrated with TPMS along its normal vectors. An index roughly reflecting the irregularity of fractal TPMS was proposed, based on which the influence of the fractal parameters on the fractal TPMS was qualitatively analyzed. Two complex samples of real porous structures were given to demonstrate the feasibility of the model. Findings - The fractal surface topography should not be neglected at a micro-scale level. In addition, a decrease in the fractal dimension Ds may exponentially make the topography rougher; an increase in the height-scaling parameter G may linearly increase the roughness; and the number of the superposed ridges has no distinct influence on the topography. Furthermore, the synthesis method is general for all implicit surfaces. Practical implications - The method provides an alternative way to shift the posteriori design paradigm of porous media to priori design mode through numeric simulation. Therefore, the optimization of AM process parameters, as well as the porous structure, can be potentially realized according to specific functional requirement. Originality/value - The synthesis of TPMS and W-M fractal geometry was accomplished efficiently and was general for all implicit freeform surfaces, and the influence of the fractal parameters on the fractal TPMS was analyzed more systematically. {\textcopyright} Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Porous structures exist widely in both natural materials and our daily life. Thanks to the properties of being lightweight, sustainable and cost efficient, it has been applied to a great extent in material engineering, meanwhile achieving much attention in shape optimization for 3D printing. However, current efforts on modeling porous structures in a given shape either consider uniform pore distributions, or regard the physical constraints as an underlying scalar field, both generating pores in an isotropic manner. The limitation is that the intrinsic directional properties of some physical terms like stresses or elasticities are not considered. It is still challenging to adapt the porous structure with the input tensor field. In this paper, we present an algorithm for modeling anisotropic porous structure, based on anisotropic centroidal Voronoi tessellations and an iteratively optimization framework in a 2.5D domain. Comparisons with isotropic porous structures show that our anisotropic structures have better adaption with the stress tensor field and thus gain better strength-to-weight ratio for the 3D printed model.},

By the creative application of traditional distance field algorithm into the Boolean operations of the anatomical model and TPMS-based unit cell library, an almost defects free porous scaffolds having the complicated micro-structure and high quality external surface faithful to a specific anatomic model can be easily obtained without the difficult and time-consuming trimming and re-meshing processes. After generating the distance fields for the given tissue model and required internal micro-structure, a series of simple modifications in distance fields enable us to obtain a complex porous scaffold. Experimental results show that the proposed scaffold design method has the potential to combine the perfectly interconnected pore networks based on the TPMS unit cell libraries and the given external geometry in a consistent framework irrespective of the complexity of the models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Topology optimization is a technique that allows for increasingly efficient designs with minimal a priori decisions. Because of the complexity and intricacy of the solutions obtained, topology optimization was often constrained to research and theoretical studies. Additive manufacturing, a rapidly evolving field, fills the gap between topology optimization and application. Additive manufacturing has minimal limitations on the shape and complexity of the design, and is currently evolving towards new materials, higher precision and larger build sizes. Two topology optimization methods are addressed: the ground structure method and density-based topology optimization. The results obtained from these topology optimization methods require some degree of post-processing before they can be manufactured. A simple procedure is described by which output suitable for additive manufacturing can be generated. In this process, some inherent issues of the optimization technique may be magnified resulting in an unfeasible or bad product. In addition, this work aims to address some of these issues and propose methodologies by which they may be alleviated. The proposed framework has applications in a number of fields, with specific examples given from the fields of health, architecture and engineering. In addition, the generated output allows for simple communication, editing, and combination of the results into more complex designs. For the specific case of three-dimensional density-based topology optimization, a tool suitable for result inspection and generation of additive manufacturing output is also provided.},

abstract = {Exciting progress in additive manufacturing (AM) technology, which enables fabrication of cellular structures with highly complex lattices and pores, has stimulated the development of lightweight structural products with improved performance and increased functionality. However, conventional design and analysis tools lack the ability to optimize complex geometries efficiently and robustly. With this motivation, in this study, homogenized material models of open-cell polymeric foams with spherical cell architectures that are manufactured by using an AM technology are formulated through both experimental and numerical investigations, which in turn can be employed in a novel micromechanics based topology optimization algorithm developed for the optimization of cellular structures. In this regard, generating computer aided drawing (CAD) data, which is mandatory for AM, randomly intersected spherical ensemble method is employed. Several foam models with different porosities are generated, and utilized in nonlinear finite element analyses (FEAs) to determine constitutive elastic constants. Plastic stress-strain data for the bulk AM material are obtained through static tensile tests in a variety of different loading directions and these results used in FEA as true stress-strain data. Homogenization is performed based on a quadratic form of the widely used Gibson and Ashby foam model, which describes the Young's modulus E∗ and yield strength $\sigma$pl∗ of cellular structures in terms of relative density. Coefficients of the quadratic scaling laws are fitted by both FEA and experiments which are compared with each other.},

Unlike classical space-filling curves such as the Peano or Hilbert curves, which constantly wind and bind to preserve locality, connected Fermat spirals are formed mostly by long, low-curvature paths. This geometric property, along with continuity, influences the quality and efficiency of layered fabrica- tion. Given a connected 2D region, we first decompose it into a set of sub-regions, each of which can be filled with a single continuous Fermat spiral. We show that it is always possible to start and end a Fermat spiral fill at approximately the same location on the outer boundary of the filled region. This special property allows the Fer- mat spiral fills to be joined systematically along a graph traversal of the decomposed sub-regions. The result is a globally continuous curve. We demonstrate that printing 2D layers following tool paths as connected Fermat spirals leads to efficient and quality fabrica- tion, compared to conventional fill patterns.},

abstract = {Decorative patterns are observed in many forms of art, typically enriching the visual aspect of otherwise simple shapes. Such patterns are especially difficult to create, as they often exhibit intricate structural details and at the same time have to precisely match the size and shape of the underlying geometry. In the field of Computer Graphics, several approaches have been proposed to automatically synthesize a decorative pattern along a curve, from an example. This empowers non expert users with a simple brush metaphor, allowing them to easily paint complex structured decorations.

We extend this idea to the space of design and fabrication. The major challenge is to properly account for the topology of the produced patterns. In particular, our technique ensures that synthesized patterns will be made of exactly one connected component, so that once printed they form a single object. To achieve this goal we propose a two steps synthesis process, first synthesizing the topology of the pattern and later synthesizing its exact geometry. We introduce topology descriptors that efficiently capture the topology of the pattern synthesized so far.

We propose several applications of our method, from designing objects using synthesized patterns along curves and within rectangles, to the decoration of surfaces with a dedicated smooth frame interpolation. Using our technique, designers paint structured patterns that can be fabricated into solid, tangible objects, creating unusual and surprising designs of lamps, chairs and laces from examples.},

Our approach utilizes multi-material microstructures as low-level building blocks of the object. We start by precomputing the material property gamut -- the set of bulk material properties that can be achieved with all material microstructures of a given size. We represent the boundary of this material property gamut using a level set field. Next, we propose an efficient and general topology optimization algorithm that simultaneously computes an optimal object topology and spatially-varying material properties constrained by the precomputed gamut. Finally, we map the optimal spatially-varying material properties onto the microstructures with the corresponding properties in order to generate a high-resolution printable structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by designing, optimizing, and fabricating objects in different material property spaces on the level of a trillion voxels, i.e several orders of magnitude higher than what can be achieved with current systems.},
