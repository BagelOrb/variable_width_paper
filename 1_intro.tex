\section{Introduction}

Compare to simple offsets with constant width

\subsection{Problem}
Too thin lines cannot be fabricated accurately.

\todo{Tim will make pictures of too thin beads and too thick beads.}

Jagged lines cause jerky problems.
Wears down mechanics.
Takes long to print.



\subsection{Goal}
\begin{itemize}
\item added 1 goal
\item zjenja added goal
\item Accurate fabrication of thin walls
\item Prevent underfilling and overfilling
\item ... for accurately matching stiffness properties
\item ... and/or translucency properties
\item Without generating paths smaller than \SI{70}{\percent} of the nozzle size
\item While generating maximally paths of \SI{140}{\percent} of the nozzle size
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A framework for generating conentric toolpaths with variable width
\end{itemize}
