\section{Validation}
Render toolpaths and calculate percentage of covered volume.

Visualize thickness of beads as color.

Show results for different settings.

Also render with nozzle size as minimal width and use middle of toolpaths instead of middle of beads.

Take same examples as Moessen: grids of triangular holes and circular holes.
Also use examples of Jin and Kao.

Use example layers of a typical object with thin walls: electronics casing.
