\section{Applications}

\subsection{Thin parts}
\begin{itemize}
\item Casings (e.g. for electronics)
\item Prototypes for blowmold parts or sheet metal parts etc.
\item Miniature models, architectural models
\item Microstructures
\item Lithophanes
\end{itemize}

show the effect of the planned toolpath on the performance of varying thickness microstructures



\subsection{Widening}
Regions where the model is narrower than the nozzle size can be printed with a bead width larger than the model thickness.
