A geometric framework for generating densely filling contour-parallel layer toolpaths employing adaptive width according to any bead width distribution scheme.

The framework is robust against small changes in the layer outlines and local changes in the layer outlines cause local changes in the output toolpaths.

The evenly distributed beading scheme which generates extrusion paths as close to the nozzle size as possible while minimizing overfill and underfill.

The inward distributed beading scheme which keeps the beads which are farther away from the center at exactly the nozzle size.
