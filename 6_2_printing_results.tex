Test prints were performed on an unmodified Ultimaker S5 system,
with a standard  \SI{0.4}{\milli\meter} nozzle
and PLA filament
and a layer thickness of $h=\SI{0.1}{\milli\meter}$.
In order to accurately realize a varying bead width we vary the movement speed, while keeping the internal pressure in the system constant.
One approach would be keep the filament inflow $f$ (in \si{\milli\meter\cubed\per\second}) constant by varying movement speed accordingly.
However, that doesn't result in the intended filament outflow variation - see \cref{zero_backpressure}.
We conjecture that the filament outflow is related to the total pressure in the system,
which depends not only on the amount of filament in between the feeder wheel and the nozzle (which we keep constant), 
but also depends on the backpressure that the previous layer exerts on the filament protruding from the nozzle.
We conjecture that the amount of backpressure is monotonically related to the requested line width and compensate for the backpressure using a simple linear model:

\begin{align}
 v(w) &= \frac{f(w)}{h w} \\ 
% f &\sim p \\
% p &= p_\text{in} + p_\text{ext} \\
% p_\text{in} &= C \\
% p_\text{ext} &\sim w \\
% p_\text{ext} &= w / w^* - 1 \\
% f &= f^* - k p_\text{ext} \\
 f(w) &= f_0 - k \left( w / w_0 - 1 \right) \\
 f_0 &= v_0 w_0 h 
% v &= \frac{f^* - k p_\text{ext}}{h w} \\ 
% v &= \frac{v^* w^* h - k (w / w^* - 1)}{h w}
\end{align}
where
$v(w)$ is the movement speed as a function of requested bead width $w$,
$f(w)$ is the filament outflow,
$f_0$ is a constant reference flow
and
$k$ is the amount of backpressure compensation.
Using increments of $0.1$ we established that using a factor of $k=1.1$ yields satisfactory bead width variation for our setup where
$v_0=\SI{30}{\milli\meter\per\second}$, 
$w_0=\SI{0.4}{\milli\meter}$.
